                In 2016-2017, at <b>The A School Collective</b> in Toronto, <b>Adam Wolfond</b> expressed a desire to capture his movements. Adam began with a desire to walk by placing a GoPro camera on various parts of his body. Later, with his artistic mentors, <b>Estée Klar</b> and <b>Kyla Brown</b>, Adam explored mark making and various cartographies documented in film and drawing. He created them by constructing \“walking-drawing machines\” that he attached to his body to reflect the hand-stim, jumping, the walk itself. Adam writes on being able to walk: \“I base my pace on you\” to describe his sensitivity to the affective milieu -  its cues - and how movement and relational are co-compositional.

The way I walk in line is timed with my noises. The walk is when I think the most. Rhythm is coming in my pleasing noises. In my noises I try to line my pace. The way of walking is also falling. It is in line with my having to think about a mommy always walking with me. Thinking about walking can also be difficult within the boy’s very busy environment (Adam, 2016).</b></i>

              \“I am the open feeler who feels too much\”
              <br>— Adam Wolfond
              <br>S/Pace
              <br><br>This exhibition film installation accompanies work with Adam regarding S/Pace where Adam explores his relation with rhythm, and space. Pace is the way Adam says he \“answers\” space - of tapping toys and waving sticks, or tapping them on his wrist. Adam declares that \“I can see the blast of the whole not like you\” and that the visual field is always moving. Waving sticks and tapping/squeezing rubber bath toys are as visually pleasing as much as self-adaptive in order to move and transition through space itself. Adam writes:
              <br><br>
              The body is always having movements and I am mobile having objects with me all the time. Boy needs objects to move. I see the objects and focus on assembled parts in the environment like a house and not the door and because I don’t see the door I manage by doing lots of amazing things like pacing my movements to the same way as my assistants. I see the whole but not the same whole as other people. They are not able to see the blast of the whole like I do. They can see the school but I can see everything gathering in the hallway moving; the forging movements of movement. Van Gogh is not like how I see but I manage moments of movement like a painter who is landing the boy’s thoughts and perceptions.
              <br><br>
              A collaboration with myself, artist Ellen Bleiwas and filmmaker, Eva Kolcze, Adam explores his relation with sticks and rubber bath toys as they \“answer\”  the space or the pace of \“fast talkers.\” Ticcing as a way to feel the world denotes proprioceptive diversity as Adam notes that,<br><br>[h]ands other than legs space good feelings because my hands are the name of mastery other than the legs. The away feeling is hard to manage, and the hands are the way I can walk. The away feeling is the way of naming the way my legs feel and I do not feel them. I want you to understand that I am always trying to feel.
              <br><br>
              Adam alludes to what Arakawa and Gins name vitality, a way of spacing space that is not self-same as in walking with legs. Madeline Gins noted that \“in order for something to be thought of, or for an object to be perceived, something (some event) will need to be adhered to, no matter how briefly\” (Gins, 1994, 10). She uses the term to \“cleave\” as to adhere to, and simultaneously \“be cut apart\” (9). \“How do I move? I can only move by eating up or dissolving where I am. I (anyone) pull in with a bright gulp what is to come next (10-11). When the hesitating, ticcing, the body also seeks to land towards its next move.  \“What happens to your position when I move, when I move a wall, or change the angle of the floor? What happens when the sidewalk always feels it is moving? (Ibid). In the hesitation, the tic, the wave of the stick, the tap of the toy, Adam cleaves and prepares to move forth. \“I can feel my arms and legs but not the ground beneath my feet,\” he writes. Adam writes towards a leaky sense of self in the world, a \“thinking-feeling through a body that is always moving\” (Adam); a way of becoming. Where Arakawa and Gins experiment with bodies in space as a form of vitality (of life-living) \“to reconfigure oneself so that you can stay alive ongoinginly\” (16), Adam’s vitality is through movement in relation - as hands, twirls, tics, taps and even my hand on his back to initiate movement when he cannot. Adam:
              <br><br>
              Ticcing through the world is like touching it… I feel the world too much so open bothersome work is to feel inside pandering to language. The work is to feel the world that is touching me.<br><br>This is neurodivesity as relation.<br><br>Reference:<br/><br>Madeline Gins. Helen Keller or Arakawa. Burning Books, 1994.</div>

                  With his fellow poet-mentor, Chris Martin of <a href="http://www.unrestrictedinterest.com/">Unrestricted Interest</a>, Adam put his finger to iPad to write two books of poetry, to be released in late 2019. Adam’s writing is, as he says, “like water,” and his reflections on experience, perception and spacetime flow in his writing. Adam’s writings are sensory and visual, lending to artistic work. His poems move us and also become the material for study in our art practice.

            <br>
            Adam’s relationship with the stick is explored in an upcoming film S/Pace, where he explores pacing with sticks to feel and navigate his body within it. For Adam, he explains how he “cannot feel the ground of his feet,” and moves with objects - thin sticks, heaving sticks -  for this grounding, suggesting incorporeal relation: intrarelation.
            <br><br>
            <b><i>
            I want to think with sticks. Thinking with sticks is like thinking about open eager space and the rows of walks I take. The wanting teetering walks think about how the sticks are going toward the next one. The desire thinks the sticks assemble the pattering honing in and offering me good help.
            <br><br>
            Time is perceived by the appreciation of language but I am pace of my body and not language. My body is pacing is the task of feeling my body and the feeling of the pace of the environment I am feeling. The work is answering in a logical way about the amazing senses but I am not sensing the same way. I am always feeling a lot of things and it’s hard to have concentration when I am not able to be a the talking-table but in the feelings of the world.” (Adam)

            Improvisation Work in Studio
            <br>
            We bring many ideas, movements, readings in studio with us. These photos show how a relational artistic collaboration emerges utilizing objects of interest to Adam - sticks and rubber bath toys. We are attentive to our movements, the way our moves affect one another, other noises and affects in the room, the soreness of our bodies during repetitive moves. Adam: “Habits are in my way of movement and sometimes I feel like using them to make bandwidth of thinking about how some habits can’t be changed. I want bandwidth to the larger acceptance of my movements to think about how you are with autistic people.” We invent with these moves, with objects, as the co-compositional, improvisational process. We rethink habits with the attunement to the transitional; when the body always feels the field’s incipient movement.

              Art uses things to assemble meaning and amazing art pays. But this is not free art. Art can mean a lot and can be a lot of things. A resting point people want is a way that we can express in typing, a reality with outward thoughts. Art is the way of lots of easy feelings. Art doesn’t necessarily pander to minds to land meaning. Good art is about really open ideas. Art is profound because it ignores intention. Feeling freedom is the most important thing in my art. Art is a feeling in my body. I want art to move toward tough and terrific feelings. It opens channels of feeling that makes the world come alive” (Adam).

            Reforming DX
            <br>
            Adam and I began by cutting up old diagnostic reports. Adam wrote about how the “language of autism” writes him off as a non-thinking person. As a mother, I have been writing about our negative experiences through the process of having to obtain a diagnosis in order for services or to be identified for school. The process of diagnosis is lead by psychologist charged with finding disability under the assumption that this will be helped or remediated. Testing occurs over two days using tests to diagnose for autism and other tests that analyze typical motor planning and verbal skills; these are to analyze intelligence. There are no tests designed for specifically autistics (do we need them?) and for they way they communicate and move because tests are designed to measure against neurotypicality. The early process of identification for us has been useless but for others, we understand it can be liberating to know that their “difference” can be attributed to something. We believe this need for identification has more to do with acceptance than obtaining help as the system of help for autistic children is intended to eradicate autism. This leaves a lifetime impression of having to keep up, of feeling inadequate as Adam writes always of wanting to talk like others to be accepted. We examine the assumptions that presume the talking-walking, humanist subject, the neurotypcial, dominates as the preferred body and how thinking about our own movements can be transformative and to shift the way we view the human, and how we become in the world. Instead of asking how we should produce art, movement, or “proper” ways of socialization, we ask how we already do so as the conditions that support neurodiversity.

            The Movement of Thought
            <br>
            Thinking with SenseLab at Concordia University,  we think of art as relational process than as object. The way we create is a way of study. We may read an excerpt of philosophy, study an artist, think about movement, bring materials to our collective. These are the materials that co-compose with us in a becoming; a way of thought as movement itself. These photos “capture” moments of our process that can never be captured.  They incite more thinking, more movement and new ways to study relation and creation. Seen in some of the photos below are burned and cut up diagnostic reports that predetermine an autistic life as “well below average.” We invent with these reports, that are otherwise static ways of locating autism as Other. How can we think beyond the pathology paradigm?

          To create is to stim. Adam reclaims the movements that neurotypicality has framed as maladaptive and that are targeted for remediation (and eradication). The autistic body is often forced to stay still, despite Adam’s prolific work on movement as necessity: “thinking is a feeling through a body that is always moving.”  Movement s/paces the environment; the environment is the ecology of people, places, things, ideas. Adam’s “stimventions” rethink the body and its moves as  creative. These are the excess that neurotypicality erases in its quest to make sense of autism, to explain its moves to meaning. Adam doesn’t write about his movements as representative, as cause and effect. His writings on movement - tic and tap, tic and stick (see his poetry, coming soon)  - never close down one singular meaning for the stim. Rather, the stim’s movement has multiple effects. The stim belongs to the multiple, where one meaning never lands for long.

            Painting and Movement
            <br><br>
            Painting is about addition and subtraction in the activity of movement. Using acrylic paint, I am always thinking about how movement co-composes with the paint, how I take it away, add more. Painting is like sculpture although I am always free to paint over it again, like a palimpsest. To paint is to move. I don’t care about the final product. Erin Manning writes about art as manner, as movement, and how the object “stands in for movement” which is how we engage in artistic relational process.

            The ice transforms in our hands. We are within icetime. We co-compose with the ice that then becomes water that then flows in many directions. A poem excerpt:
            <br><br>
            <b><i>
            Water forges toward
            <br><br>
            the long way of thought
            <br><br>
            the way the water always
            <br><br>
            moves is like the way I think
            <br><br>
            toward movement - Adam
            </b></i>

            Duration and Detail
            <br><br>
            Photos are taken to document thinking process. I take photos with my iPhone with particular interest in movement and duration. Some shapes lure me to the detail rather than the whole, as Adam also writes that he sees the detail as “forging movement” as a “blast,” invoking an understanding of the busy visual/affective field, and a sensitivity to the multiple lures for attention. Elizabeth Grosz, citing Henri Bergson, suggests that attunement is intuition that attends to the durational. The durational is where difference in degree emerges: “Intuition… is a ‘shadow’, a ‘swirling of dust’, more than a concrete and well-formed concept. It is an emergent and imprecise movement of simplicity that erupts by negating the old, resisting temptations of intellect to understand the new in terms of the language and concepts of the old” (Grosz, becoming undone: Darwinian Reflections on Life, Politics and Art, 2011, 48).

            <br><br>
            When I began my PhD study and collaboration with Adam, I realized that drawing concepts was helpful in order think through the philosophical ideas as a practice. It is a way of thinking with movement the way Adam once wrote “thinking is a feeling through a body that is always moving.” Following Deleuze & Guattari, this artistic/intraethnographic collaboration works between the molar/molecular: “The world as multiplicity, as constituted by movements of differences in intensity” (O’Sullivan, 31). Relation and its assembled meshworks are in perpetual motion. Language, as in writing for academia, as an example, asks me to suspend the movement.  It is within a creative artistic process that we have developed an intraethnography as the intrasubjective collaboration that questions the production of subjectivity as coming from one voice. We also question identity-thinking that belongs to the articulation of the humanist subject.
            <br><br>
            A PhD requires new concepts to be created which is difficult in the process of writing traditionally, so I gravitated towards this artistic practice with Adam to understand rhythm, movement, relation, duration as important concepts in the discussion of “difference” and collaboration. Difference as duration, from Henri Bergson, are also affective events, and what happens around them are the excess that the “coherent” academic paper alone delimits. Adam and I both resist writing that is instrumental in nature (this instrumentality when it comes to autism is to be methodologically prescriptive in terms of remediation and cure).  We also refer to our artistic practice as our life; it is has arisen from the way we move and survive in the world, outside of educational systems that have excluded us both as mother and son. These journals are daily reflections of collective readings and discussions with Adam and other readings we engage together.
            <br><br>
            Adam and I, often with members of The A Collective, bring readings or “situations” derived from others as an “enabling constraint” to begin. We might, for example, think around the concept of repetition and how that is taken up in various fields. In the behavioural psychology fields (also adopted by other clinical/therapeutic regimes), for example, repetition and obsessive interests are pathologized.  Repetition is too simply characterized as behavioural (maladaptive) rather than as pleasurable, necessary, adaptive, generative. In the development of a skill, repetition is a practice for the development of technique. Repetition is also mastery. Repetition brings something into existence. Repetition spaces space (as in proprioception). It lands and moves again. Repetition stabilizes, sort of, because in repetition there are always new movements and affects coming forth, in the field of relation. We think deeply about repetition in terms of how it is positioned as mastery and human, and then move it toward autistic repetition outside the pathology paradigm.

            Mobile Writing
            <br>
            We think about form, proper grammatical form, language that can delimit expression rather than move with it.  Writing aims to parse experience whereas neurodiverse experssion immerses within it, making writing a movement process. Adam describes movement with language as it is happens in the moment of writing. Collective writing also moves with affective forces, other voices, readings. We are always immersed despite an assumption that writing happens alone; that we are independent authors. This immersion is more pronounced in Adam’s writing, as his words resonate feelings and relations, rather than explicate them.
            <br><br>
            Using a typewriter in this work,  I let myself make mistakes, thinking about thinking itself, and I find myself stumbling; I am anxious about being “correct.”  I think too much about the movement to hit the right key, and I hesitate. When I type too fast, I hit the wrong keys. Thinking about movement simultaneously with the thoughts I think I want to express is difficult to think about separately, but that is how Adam describes the difficulty of movement. My thought-goal is entwined with the present moment of movement-moving toward the future sentence. My thoughts shift as I write; the goal of expression is lost in the process of movement-typing to become something more; the writing is affected by the moments and feelings I am within. I then look at the writing itself, in its material form; typing without correction. This is the writing-event expressed as it was expressing.  I am thinking about this along with Adam’s writing about how hard it can be to type as he discusses how he has to think deliberately about his movements to the keyboard, and with relational affective collaboration, or support, he brings expression to form.

            Relationshapes
            <br><br>
            Relationshapes are affective movement drawings. Also cartographies of contrapuntal movement, these drawings reflect how space and relation affect the way we move. This is not directed movement, not coerced or choreographed. This is simply attunement to how we move and a way to think about how support is always mobile and undulating. I also drew the affect, however, of movement that was directed from therapists and schools.
            <br><br>
            These drawings emerged as the the non-written contribution to rethinking how we tend to engage with autistic people. I was attentive to the professional team meetings; where the therapists dictate strategies within the pathology paradigm. Also, where there is a team leader on a typical autism team or in a school meeting, the hierarchy is felt. The way we must engage with the autistic person in the clinical sense, becomes a prescription and a strategy as opposed to a mutual collaboration. The autistic is the object toward which these methodologies are enacted. The way curriculum and classrooms are run are also directing hierarchical “bank-deposit” education.
            <br><br>
            Fernand Deligny’s work (1913-1996) resembles this; where he mapped the movements of autistics at his commune in Cevennes, France. Deligny did not aim to rehabilitate the autistic. This collaboration with Adam extends Deligny’s work in that Adam contributes to the way he feels and the way he wants to collaborate and also, participate in his own education.  Drawing affective movement was a way for me to think of collaboration as mutual and also, to think about how movement cues movement.
            <br><br>
            I am a lot of the time thinking about how to move. I want the art to have a feeling of the boy’s assembling of the really tough movement. I want good art about movement to give people the ideas of the way I don’t always answer in words. I think that people ask questions to assembled ideas that always please them and they hope sometimes that their questions are backed by my typing. My art opens understandings of autism that feels relations with good people and my environment. Activating movement for me is because of the support the body has feeling with another body. I want art about movement to give people ideas about the way I don’t answer in words. Can a good body feel without another body? (Adam, 2016).
