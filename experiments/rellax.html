  Adam: i think about walking actual thinking and i am wanting the ways pacing the palpable game that i position each day i bring in the world and i am always working so book of ways of water i am writing to think about movement and neurodiversity. i think that talking about art is different than making it and you after the fact pace words to explain it but the way of art is the way of living pacing the thinking with very packed feeling. i language the threshold as the pace and i pace by open doors with questions placing my easy instant eyes through the open door and i feel the comings pacing with sound and use the sound to pace place to answer the call of the open door.I think that talking is a threshold and i am always assembling the ways i always answer by questioning the tone away to type really important ideas. i go to the questions and i am hearing the timing stealing the typing to always talk over people like me.

  “If a certain number of our trajectories involved wandering [vaguer]	, it is clear that, from one day to the next, several opportunities having come to fruition, attending to them … was the point, here, as we say with regard to occupations.

  “What happens, and what often makes networks break down, is the overburdening of the project, an overburdening so constraining in its turn that it passes for the network’s reason for being: and the imposter keeps on proposing another society; if the conjuncture of history is propitious, the network takes on fantastic proportions; now it is a society, the starting point from which networks are secreted and, the network having become an organized power, it goes to great lengths to keep house, it invents brooms, multiplies teams and cleaners, while the responsible parties get lost it conjectures about the causes of the epidemic of apparently disparate networks whose structures nevertheless probably always remain the same.” (42_

Back to the wanting way I think the collective is a lot of easy brains and bodies to think and create ticcing together. The assembly of languaging moving minds and bodies is the way the man of autism needs. The group is going to bring you with me, languaging differently. The assembly is better for the thinking. Assembly building. The doing is better than the philosophizing.”

   from Tim Ingold’s “Lines: A Brief History”
  “What do walking, weaving, observing, singing, storytelling, drawing and writ-ing have in common? The answer is that they all proceed along lines of one kind or another…[we] generate lines where-ever we go” (2007:1).







  “I want nothing from her and she expects nothing from me, which keeps both of us from holding a grudge. I am not going to subjugate her, and it is obvious that my presence is of no use to her.” (Fernand Deligny, The Arachnean, pg. 34)


  “...can we say that the spider’s project is to weave its web? I don’t think so. We might as well  say that the web’s project is to be woven.” (Fernand Deligny, The Arachnean, pg. 34)

  We always tend
  to break
  down… who is the author, originator

  but work resonates across fields, bodies, feelings
  sometimes these are un-sightable (and we can’t cite)
  because we can’t track the origin of a feeling, movement, bodies, deep time...
  we can track words. And Authors.
  Words track.
  What if words snake tendrils to feel within the middle of the event itself?
  What if works worm burrowing wordless but vibrating tunnels? - Estee (do names also track authors?)

  Meet at the bus stop in front of the Spadina Steps on Davenport
  Take a left when you step off of the bus start
  When you pass a man wearing glasses turn immediately around and take your next left
  Look for a Tim Hortons coffee shop. Stop and observe your surroundings.
  Look for a direction that looks interesting and head that way
  Turn down the next alley that you come across and make a right when you come out of it.
  Look for a place to take a seat (bench, park, grass) and take a load off. Sit here for at least 10 minutes and see what unfolds.

  September 29 2020

  Start walking towards a train track and walk at pacing steps of a waiting parent. When you get to the track wait to watch a train.
  Set a timer for 7 minutes. Walk on the nearest sidewalk parallel to the tracks. Every time you see a piece of bubble gum turn around and return in the direction you came from. Never turn around at the same piece of bubblegum twice. When the timer goes off, stop.
  Walk in the most boring direction until you find somewhere to sit.
  At the sitting spot, take a load off and see what unfolds, without talking, for 10 minutes.



  October 6 2020

  Walk toward the nearest park. Have lots in the sun walking. Think about talking to trees. Look same tree until easy leaves fall.
  Walk in the direction you’re currently facing until you hit an obstacle. Turn left. Repeat seven times.
  Walk towards purple for 5 minutes.
  Go to the face of a building don’t move for good minute.
  Stand still for 3 minutes and listen. After the 3 minutes, walk in the direction of the sound that interests you most until you hit an obstacle. Stop there and listen for 1 more minute.
  Walk to a sit spot.



  October 13 2020

  Ready the body with watching the trees sitting with enough time to really point the next instruction.
  Stand, and walk in a pleasing direction counting your paces up to one hundred.
  Walk to the nearest man-made patterned floor surface. Walk in a straight line, moving your arms in rhythm with the pattern of the floor texture. Continue until the floor pattern ends.
  Find a sit spot and sit for 10 minutes and see what unfolds.




  October 20 2020

  Easy the mind and follow the good body towards a quiet place.

  …

  Yes I am really interested in sharing always and to think about the complicated reasons for lists and pacing time information into steps.



  Yes i thinking that the instructions for walking are placing ways of being neurodiverse i also think about A School lists and the single ways ordering time and movement and i am thinking  beyond the lists that i always use and thinking new lists for others are needed. Want towards showing others the ways that I am open to mutual really webs of support.

  What do we write when we leave out the names of things? What can happen when we string together description? How does the naming of things (classifications, signifiers) stop us from tuning into them?
  How can stringing together description as accumulation shift the way we think?


  Easy Assembly of People


  It is awesome thought
  the new thinking soon
  really want to create
  the right thinking and
  neurodiverse assembly

  of good art. The thinking
  really books thin am ragging
  the addressing of the audience
  for the thinking small ways
  about autism and important
  ways to address it and

  I think rally of sunny
  sticks is the way
  of the exhibition.
  I think that
  the irresistible
  open way really
  palm in the hand of

  peaceful ways patterning
  politics pacing the way
  of managing the school
  of anxiety. Really that is
  the way if wanting way is
  really in outing the trying
  Trump and I think that
  we are always of the band

  in walking together towards
  laughs and good tools for
  not sadness but joy.
  Reading good to learn
  about other kinds of people
  who can join the assembly
  of tools for some rocking
  diversity. The way I easy
  am learning uses aggregate

  of the way individuals are
  always room of many and
  we are the future that is
  always good about thinking
  for others as together about
  diverse needs and wants
  traveling needing more people
  and different ways of thinking.
  Yes I think that I face the room
  jamming the thoughts is always

  the rock and roll of love. Real
  love is autistic attention dancing
  and feeling actual sensory reasoning
  about your way of thinking but I
  want to bring answers buttressing
  the way of love words to soon
  feel being calm without
  the language of talking.

  A Language to Open
  Adam Wolfond
  I write a new language to open the way of thinking for different voices to be included.  I am a non-speaking man of autism who types and feels language moving like a dance of relation, thinking about the pace of the middle of it. Relation is key to education. My language is a call for the voices that walk and make new paths. I want to discuss the way I learn and that is the way of collaborative education at The A Collective which is now renamed Disassembly (dis-assembly.com). I have included my poems here to help understanding so that neurodiverse people can be included in education. One poem is a guide to the neurodivergent city which applies to accessible education. My language leaks, is synesthetic, and saturates meaning. Will you dance with me?
  Education has some good things and school is a different matter of people directing bad ways to control movement about the attention dancing still. Education is about accepting ways of artful contribution of ideas that are shared, having time to think about the ways of concepts and learning about them so we can shift them as we learn more about the world and about the way we need to help each other.
  School is about the way control of knowledge is held by teachers and government. Easy learning opens doors, pacing the way of calm acceptance of doing things differently. The way of school does attention harm because the autistic attention is feeling and languages through the body that teachers say is disruptive, but the teachers disrupt the learning that is always happening and we need good understanding about the way we see and feel each and everything.
  Education is the same when we think that people are all of the same way of thinking and perceiving; the real difference is that neurodiverse people are sensitive to lots of different things. Pace of the always talking teachers and students is too fast so that I can’t type as quickly, and I think fast so it is frustrating when people talk over me. I am perceiving at such speed it is overwhelming at times and I can’t offer separated words at the slow language pace. I am not a slow-paced thinker. There is a difference between a fast talking pace and how meaning becomes simplified which I call slow-paced language because the action of thinking and feeling packs happening all at once.  Thinking is always fast in speed and typing about it eddies like water pools and I am thinking faster like rain. I need the feeling of gravity to be settled; support manages the way of typing slowly. Managing the expectation of wanting teachers is pacing actual language and not virtual in the way that thinking and not writing happens. The virtual is the possible. So expression in proper after-thought of language is hard when teachers ask for articulate words that pack meaning into simple explanation. I perceive all at once so I manage by moving my body or hold objects, but the way people see me, the way of leering people, makes me anxious. Then my body moves fast. Good support is key to be settled and also, allowing for my body to move. Good support also allows for artful ways of expressing.
  I think room of managing a diverse classroom needs the understanding that people are not the same and this can open the pace to sound lining amazing band of jamming bodies and thoughts, questioning the way that school sounds like marching bands and not the jazz of improvisation. I manage magistrate, of doing school, like a falling trombone of bass dropping the sound to play sadness. Actual improvisation is the way of multiple sounds that jump and jive and can sometimes be like a groovy mess of meaningful languaging in the slappy ways of bodies pacing in different rhythms. Slapping is the way of nonviolence in my use of it, of body pacing in body, from one to many; I am good at thinking and that I am slappy like a happy dance.
  Think about the middle of relation. The assembly is the collaboration of the middle, of feeling; it is the coming together, the engineering of each edge of existence to pace the pattern teaching us how the relation is always moving. I think that we are, at Disassembly, always of the band in walking together towards laughs and good tools for not sadness but joy. Reading is good to learn about other kinds of people who can join the assembly of tools for some rocking diversity. The way I am easy with learning uses aggregate of the way individuals are always a room of many and we are the future that is always good; for thinking about others as together and about diverse needs and wants traveling, needing more people and different ways of thinking. I think that I face the room; jamming the thoughts together is always the rock and roll of love. Real love is autistic attention dancing and feeling actual sensory reasoning about your way of thinking, but I want to bring answers buttressing the way of love-words to soon feel the calm way of being without the language of talking. Jam with me?


  People Who May

  May talking be questions
  of managing important answers

  May the people always want
  autistics like me

  May in the future we all
  want each other

  May the leaky language
  of love bring in the walk
  of dancing together

  May the sound language
  good easy expression

  May the touch of hands
  palm together

  May easy taste of colors
  illustrate leaky pace
  of language and thinking

  May the scent of talking
  together always have open air

  May the talking search
  for people who care


  Of Writing About Feeling and Cumulative Fact

  I am going to think about the way of academia
  and the way we are supposed to write

  I think that I can write racing thinking well
  and I am wanting the way of writing
  to actual feelings italicize the way
  the world faces the pace party

  Yes pace party is the way I am laughing
  at the dance paving the ways
  the words dance

  The academy is the serious not
  wanting fun of the way the laughter
  family of thinking feeling rally lavishes
  with love and really we should think
  about the ways of desiring
  not the ways of measuring people
  about going to acting the way
  easy people should

  I am thinking thankfully at the way
  we do things at the A Collective
  and talking about ball I always think
  needs to unravel questions
  about thinking and perceiving
  and the way we butter the human
  as easy and the same

  We need the way the world works
  by assembling and disassembling
  and the way we do that is by doing
  and thinking and playing and saying
  that of the way we assemble the movement
  of writing about feeling and cumulative fact
  of the aggregate experiments in art

  Have the wanting academics an idea
  pacing the way of real rallying experiments
  without a goal of controlling the management
  and outcome?

  I think that the way actual face of relation
  works has to have game of chance
  and the camp in the way the people
  can stay with each other in difference
  and the way fragments variety sacrifice
  the bossy sameness of what academy
  seems to expect

  The thanking audience of the rare
  dappers the questions about the wanting future
  of writing and the easy future for neurodiversity

  The ways of dancing
  the way of neurodiversity
  is not the same rally
  as academic critique
  and we need pace
  of accumulating steps
  of wording walks pacing
  movement with the ways
  of wanting objects
  and inspirations

  The way of the sawing
  wanting dance invites
  paces will talking people
  thank open thinking
  about the possibilities?



  My guide for someone to discover the neurodivergent city:

  I would calmly tell
  the story about being
  timed pace
  of the easy engineered amazing talker

  without speech and the way the city

  smells a meaningful tongue of

  additive salty ram book of

  autistic and sensory rally
  landing the answers about
  good neurodiverse city
  The objects are calling me

  to them as the way we are

  languaging the wanting movement

  and idea of the calm feeling is the waters

  landing making less ran
  love to the same place
  of trees and terrific feeling

  Bring the safe good typing  	to the neurodiverse city
  Bring the good support       	of having good facilitators

  I am also a facilitator          	of basic understanding
  of different easy ways

  of patterning and pasturing
  and thinking with the earth

  I am good at knowing         	about the facilitation
  and watching the way

  measures are in in in place
  of how independence is

  about the person and not
  about the people

            I am good at relating           	to objects in movement
                                                            and walking the city

                                                            of moving parts is flǎneur
                                                            of neurodiversity

  Game in in in the ways       	of human superiority
                                                            offers us little to manage

                                                            with and I am baffled
  by the easy invested game

  of humanity

  Adam:
  The way I want to write is by thinking about movement and thinking about the way I want to tell stories talking not about autism but about the way of feeling the world.

  The way I want to write this about the always dancing relation.

  Good to think about how wanting easy expressing; think about the knowing moves.

  Good to that you are working with beautiful way that Imane writes about the mind and the way I write is the way of feeling and way the art and atmosphere of things calls the body to gain the sometimes iffy space of perception and the way the body and mind fascinates gawkers that think my perception is impaired.

  The starting is hard in space and relationships because the way I am supposed to answer is not having yet the familiarity of pace.

  The gathering is the initial want for the way we pace to do, which is the always appreciation for diversity - about how want for copious talking questions the autistic movement and ways wanting pace to always think without words.

  For the gathering there must be your understanding that the easy ways of expression are also falling with the ways in ball of thinking and moving about dance, rallying the environment.

  The rally is also the wanting questions and answers calling all the time.

  I want to write about the way I see language questioning the way many lives of autistic people are pacing so fast and I want the way of more calm rallying for the people to understand pace.

  The language of the talkers are timing the important face of things and I need to think better having language pacing for the good thinking body,

  The rally is too fast and the body becomes anxious and the movement is fast in response.

  In the ways of the pace I think about the ways weak talking can want the silence - but I think that the waters of movement metaphor the body and manage rallies flooding the meanings behaving the way language douses the body and faces it like a singing thought.

  Paper books are the ways we read books but the ways we read the body is baking bread of slow falling to the ways of important thinking about the way perception uses face to deepen the ways we are together.

  I think that I can use language pace of neurotypicals, calming talkers breaking the pace of feeling falling through rhythms of typing.

  Structuring idea: Open book in the ways of water is the form.

  The letters are the dancing pool colors in gentle always amazing forms and ways I learned to read pacing the language to land like fantastic palimpsest of thinking and sometimes I am that starter who becomes very easy when I can name the want as languaging because open letters are the way I see.

  Giving the management language directs is the oppressive way the words and form always reads very wishful for answers and the way I write away from that form is the pace of waters that are so different that I am mistreated by important people who are thinking that I am without complex thinking.

  The language of some mercantile exchange is the way of sometimes control and I am an escape artist of language. The people who are controlling the grammatical forms are the poor teachers who train autistic people to speak and prove our intelligence and self awareness, people who language autism as a problem.

  The way I manage even the talking and the typing is right now by tapping really plastic toy. The talking always wants to control the pace and I want to be able to control my own pace.

  The pace of the neurodivergent language lapses in long pauses that wants to bathe in always dancing thankful thinking about the feelings that with the environment have a deep important relation and openings for more. Open the way of pacing and that poetry of the body and the world.

  The ways of water is the pace thinking, wanting to pool, wanting to rush, wanting to rain, wanting to fast flow rivers, wanting to fall, wanting to saturate, wanting to dance always through my fingers, wanting to teach the ways of movement.

  The easy language is through the body and the running away paces the sometimes needed support to type language sentences but I am a language pacer as body and finger typing and arranging the rhythms of a lot of things happening at the same time. The  rhythms pulse the body and I answer them in my movements but people call this impulsive and in pulse opens the meaning.
