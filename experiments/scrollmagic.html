we answer by
pacing open
facing each but not really facing… joining and dis-jointing
Like breathing in and out
assembly
Together is a riot - ous way to listen quiet - Ly
Moving…. Movement listening expressing
hesitating/ticcing is a move in the process of moving…

Adam: i think about walking actual thinking and i am wanting the ways pacing the palpable game that i position each day i bring in the world and i am always working so book of ways of water i am writing to think about movement and neurodiversity. i think that talking about art is different than making it and you after the fact pace words to explain it but the way of art is the way of living pacing the thinking with very packed feeling. i language the threshold as the pace and i pace by open doors with questions placing my easy instant eyes through the open door and i feel the comings pacing with sound and use the sound to pace place to answer the call of the open door.I think that talking is a threshold and i am always assembling the ways i always answer by questioning the tone away to type really important ideas. i go to the questions and i am hearing the timing stealing the typing to always talk over people like me.

“If a certain number of our trajectories involved wandering [vaguer] , it is clear that, from one day to the next, several opportunities having come to fruition, attending to them … was the point, here, as we say with regard to occupations. The space, once occupied, lost something of its vagueness, then. And that meant the disappearance of the infinitive to wander, a term whose extraordinary richness we can glimpse” (38)
“What happens, and what often makes networks break down, is the overburdening of the project, an overburdening so constraining in its turn that it passes for the network’s reason for being: and the imposter keeps on proposing another society; if the conjuncture of history is propitious, the network takes on fantastic proportions; now it is a society, the starting point from which networks are secreted and, the network having become an organized power, it goes to great lengths to keep house, it invents brooms, multiplies teams and cleaners, while the responsible parties get lost it conjectures about the causes of the epidemic of apparently disparate networks whose structures nevertheless probably always remain the same.” (42_ Fernand Deligny, The Arachnean and Other Texts. In other words, let us never merely “keep house,” but devote
ourselves to the assiduous animal possibility of rebuilding it
seeking always the master builder that emerges in aggregate
and who lets the surplus of the mind be abundance dancing

Society… the overburdening project that positions autism as a burden… in order to make society.
Audre Lorde: “Institutionalized rejection of difference is an absolute necessity in a profit economy which needs outsiders as surplus people. As members of such an economy, we have all been programmed to respond to human differences between us with fear and loathing” - Your Silence Will Not Protect You, 95.
Assemblages assembling… dendrites blossoming
Becoming more than
We are more than individual. We individuate in relation. We are our own surplus
Transforming identities
more than individual - in l i n e - in s y n c — sometimes dissonant… dissonance is also necessary for becoming
Connections between different things constitutes the assemblage
Connections are made and remade… horizontally, slanted-ly… “from the side” rather than hierarchically.
Notice how the orientation of this page, this word document only allows us to write in one direction? How do these forced orientations make us think, relate… and organize?

When Adam began to anticipate his poetry writing, he named it “poet Tree” — think of the branches as continual trajectories building on one another… horizontal, vertical, curved, folding, knotting…sprouting….
Think of poetry sticks Slanting dangling in space but nevertheless phrases sparking new phrases...connecting.

BALL OF THINKINGFEELING (CY TWOMBLY - NOT ACTUAL TITLE)
ADAM WOLFOND:

Assemblage is a way to think about relational interactions including how bodies affect and are affected.
Human and non human affective assemblages



Ball of thinking pacing
A web of pliancy
A dear thread read
in all directions
by the ear most of all

A line of thought———————————-/—-//————————-...............,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,”””””””””””” ••• •. •

How to connect in the open s/pace?
The project that does not demand to know what it is doing
It does the open way

Doing and undoing

“A spiral that tries to find its way” -Adam
A walk that makes how its direction Awake to marks that showcase
the wreckage of the master’s house
A market where the cages are wrested
open and bruised fruit is given freely
<br>
The how emerges the open hand extends not knowing
<br>
Now is the time
the lexicon is the palette
A springboard for the tongue snailing a spiral toward words
The way people need to you
question is the way open
book is reading making at
once at raining thoughts
droplets problems droplets opulent droplets
pleat and throb through weathering thoughts

The open wanting way of words wayfaring Between drifting and searching To drift
What does the “thought out project mean?” what if we can draw out the Thought -------- Out? Like the wayfaring path discovered in the moment we come into each step? Thought-out project does not necessarily mean to preconceive the project. This brings into the array the very idea of thought as “own”... as in ownership, authored; how thought is not owned but always in relation…. Thought …..out in the open, making connections, gluing to other structures - the continued weaving…
The assembly is not a void
To innate support structures we attune On the lookout in the network becomes our response ability
Beyond the thought-out project… Thought, instead moves out Thought------------------------------------------------------------out and open feeling “Art is the open way of telling” - Adam

Adam: “Ball of thinking about the rugged capability places learning to be neurodiversely pacing the easy way i answer opening toward the thinking about facing the world as i am. Back to the wanting way I think the collective is a lot of easy brains and bodies to think and create ticcing together. The assembly of languaging moving minds and bodies is the way the man of autism needs. The group is going to bring you with me, languaging differently. The assembly is better for the thinking. Assembly building. The doing is better than the philosophizing.”
from Tim Ingold’s “Lines: A Brief History” “What do walking, weaving, observing, singing, storytelling, drawing and writ-ing have in common? The answer is that they all proceed along lines of one kind or another…[we] generate lines where-ever we go” (2007:1).

“I want nothing from her and she expects nothing from me, which keeps both of us from holding a grudge. I am not going to subjugate her, and it is obvious that my presence is of no use to her.” (Fernand Deligny, The Arachnean, pg. 34)
“...can we say that the spider’s project is to weave its web? I don’t think so. We might as well say that the web’s project is to be woven.” (Fernand Deligny, The Arachnean, pg. 34)

Our anti-mission; our aim, rather is a dream: to outstrip encrusted habits of thought … to fabulate new modes of existence that carry us “off the rails” (Deleuze)
