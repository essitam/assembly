It is an outgrowth of The A School which was formed in 2016 as a creative school as a result of exclusion and shifted towards an artistic-philosophical curriculum aimed at discovering and supporting the conditions for neurodiversity to emerge and thrive. We become neurodiverse together, with an interdisciplinary group and approach to knowledge and also, for research creation and for work in creative pedagogical approaches. We are located in Toronto, Canada, originally co-founded by Estée Klar and Adam Wolfond, and proliferated by the A Collective group. Estée and Adam are mother and non-speaking autistic son, and have published the dissertation Neurodiversity in Relation: an artistic intraethnography at York University. Estée holds a PhD in Critical Disability studies, supported by the prolific thoughts and publications by Adam Wolfond and also, the collaboration with the participants at The A Collective which consist of other non-speaking people who type to communicate, educators, artists, poets and people who identify as neurodiverse or neurodivergent. The Collective emerged also from participating at SenseLab with Erin Manning and Brian Massumi at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. Their interest in relational art, philosophy and neurodiversity synchronized with our work in Toronto, that is, processual thinking and working together to find our own way of thinking and creating, together. Estée was awarded a SSHRC grant to complete the film S/Pace with Adam and the A Collective, and her former training as an artist and curator has brought other artists/mentors to also think with neurodivergent people to co-create and think more deeply about contribution and collaboration in order also to create supportive networks of care. The Collective grew to include younger participants who do not typically have access to self-determination with support. We view agency in this regard as collaborative. We are never unto ourselves but are mutually supported in a network of collective care that enables what we call agencement rather than agency. s </p> <p > The A Collective emerged from Klar’s work in creative schooling after becoming frustrated at ongoing exclusion of Adam. Schools would not allow his personal and communication support assistant in the classroom. In the public system in Toronto, it was a union issue in that only Educational Assistants were to provide the support, which removed the relational and training component of communication support (no EA is trained in facilitated communication or supported typing and AAC in general). We learned that relational support was also essential for navigating the many transitions and movements within the school environment, yet, EA’s were mostly temporary, and rotated among children. There was no permanence to individualized support. With a culture that supports ABA or IBI in Canada, the emphasis was on making the autistic person as independent as possible, thereby denying access to education in the meantime with the promise that this behavioural therapy would remediate. This remediation had to achieve these goals before inclusion into the classroom – before access to education was granted. </p> <p > We also noticed that the linear development model, born in the 1800’s to regulate education like a pipeline to factory work, began to create the assumption of normality, leading to the development of structural and systemic neurotypicality. That is, if you were diverse in any way, and could not follow developmental timelines, you were considered delayed, disorded, disabled. The social construction aspect of disability was enacted through the system of education and many were left behind – in institutions and later, into segregated school settings which is just another form of institutionalization. While the public education system created a tributary of special education, after the age of 21, many with disabilities were sent to the institutions and group homes anyway. </p> <p > Being an artist, Estee learned early about not belonging. The arts were never valued, except as entertainment, and unless popularized entertainment, largely underpaid. However, the arts accessed another mode of expression and communication outside of economic value-profit models. This became a way of thinking in non-economic, neoliberalized terms, as well as for people who made diverse contributions to society. </p> <p > Looking to the creative schooling model when she established The A School, located in Forest Hill Village in Toronto mainly for Adam, she had a vision to enact caring and creative pedagogies that supported neurodiverse ways of movement and expression. Rather than thinking of this as accommodation and access practices alone, these became autistic-led practices that emerged in relation with objects, with other people, within spaces that revealed how spaces are apprehended and perceived, and how movement processes helped the body to settle within them. The tables and chairs dissapeard and on-the-floor couches and pillows took over. Lap desks replaced table surfaces. </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Assembly: A Laboratory for Neurodiverse Experimentation for Relation </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We are </p> <p > a collaborative learning and supportive assemblage dedicated to neurodiversity and shifting research creation and knowledge </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We begin </p> <p > with the premise that experimentation and process is at the heart of experience and collaboration, we attune to the conditions that support and proliferate neurodiversity </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We move </p> <p > between philosophy, language and art for relanguaging and conception of neurodiverse movement and pace through relation, affect and materials (what we have named relationshapes) </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> What moves us </p> <p > diversity and relation bringing art, philosophy, critical disability studies together to rethink new modes of life and new forms of value </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Who it addresses </p> <p > • all ages and any level of education, neurodiverse or neurotypical who wish to engage in mutual support and learning as a life-long process of social engagement • for those interested in networks of sustainability for support, education, care • students and teachers looking for a transdisciplinary, neurodiverse milieu to supplement their studies and interested in learning explorative techniques • community workers, caregivers, supporters, artists, teachers and activists wishing to explore neurodiversity and collaborative creation to expand their domain of practice </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Keywords: </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Relation, Neurodiversity, Research-Creation, Sustainability, Conviviality, Process </p> <br><p class=\"wobblyText\"> ANTI-MISSION STATEMENT: </p> <p > The A Collective exists as a creative collaborative space where relation is at the core of study for the purposes of shifting disability and inclusion policy in Canada. We utilize arts-based methods for creative works inventing with neurodiversity. We work towards the enactment of inclusion, rethinking how inclusion has been deployed in Canada, revolving around existing normative systems. We provide social groups, reading groups and alternative learning strategies informed by autistic people. </p> </div>",
    walkingdrawing: "<div class=\"walkingdrawing\"><h1>walking-drawing machines</h1><div >In 2016-2017, at The A School Collective in Toronto, Adam Wolfond expressed a desire to capture his movements. Adam began with a desire to walk by placing a GoPro camera on various parts of his body. Later, with his artistic mentors, Estée Klar and Kyla Brown, Adam explored mark making and various cartographies documented in film and drawing. He created them by constructing \“walking-drawing machines\” that he attached to his body to reflect the hand-stim, jumping, the walk itself. Adam writes on being able to walk: \“I base my pace on you\” to describe his sensitivity to the affective milieu -  its cues - and how movement and relational are co-compositional.</div><div>The house is my body in the amazing movement of walking. In the pattern of my body I am single pattern of walking. Walking happens in my good head. The way I walk in line is timed with my noises. The walk is when I think the most. Rhythm is coming in my pleasing noises. In my noises I try to line my pace. The way of walking is also falling. It is in line with my having to think about a mommy always walking with me. Thinking about walking can also be difficult within the boy’s very busy environment (Adam, 2016).</div></div>",

Pace is the way Adam says he \“answers\” space - of tapping toys and waving sticks, or tapping them on his wrist. Adam declares that \“I can see the blast of the whole not like you\” and that the visual field is always moving. Waving sticks and tapping/squeezing rubber bath toys are as visually pleasing as much as self-adaptive in order to move and transition through space itself. Adam writes:<br><br>The body is always having movements and I am mobile having objects with me all the time. Boy needs objects to move. I see the objects and focus on assembled parts in the environment like a house and not the door and because I don’t see the door I manage by doing lots of amazing things like pacing my movements to the same way as my assistants. I see the whole but not the same whole as other people. They are not able to see the blast of the whole like I do. They can see the school but I can see everything gathering in the hallway moving; the forging movements of movement. Van Gogh is not like how I see but I manage moments of movement like a painter who is landing the boy’s thoughts and perceptions.<br><br>A collaboration with myself, artist Ellen Bleiwas and filmmaker, Eva Kolcze, Adam explores his relation with sticks and rubber bath toys as they \“answer\”  the space or the pace of \“fast talkers.\” Ticcing as a way to feel the world denotes proprioceptive diversity as Adam notes that,<br><br>[h]ands other than legs space good feelings because my hands are the name of mastery other than the legs. The away feeling is hard to manage, and the hands are the way I can walk. The away feeling is the way of naming the way my legs feel and I do not feel them. I want you to understand that I am always trying to feel.<br><br>Adam alludes to what Arakawa and Gins name vitality, a way of spacing space that is not self-same as in walking with legs. Madeline Gins noted that \“in order for something to be thought of, or for an object to be perceived, something (some event) will need to be adhered to, no matter how briefly\” (Gins, 1994, 10). She uses the term to \“cleave\” as to adhere to, and simultaneously \“be cut apart\” (9). \“How do I move? I can only move by eating up or dissolving where I am. I (anyone) pull in with a bright gulp what is to come next (10-11). When the hesitating, ticcing, the body also seeks to land towards its next move.  \“What happens to your position when I move, when I move a wall, or change the angle of the floor? What happens when the sidewalk always feels it is moving? (Ibid). In the hesitation, the tic, the wave of the stick, the tap of the toy, Adam cleaves and prepares to move forth. \“I can feel my arms and legs but not the ground beneath my feet,\” he writes. Adam writes towards a leaky sense of self in the world, a \“thinking-feeling through a body that is always moving\” (Adam); a way of becoming. Where Arakawa and Gins experiment with bodies in space as a form of vitality (of life-living) \“to reconfigure oneself so that you can stay alive ongoinginly\” (16), Adam’s vitality is through movement in relation - as hands, twirls, tics, taps and even my hand on his back to initiate movement when he cannot. Adam:<br><br>Ticcing through the world is like touching it… I feel the world too much so open bothersome work is to feel inside pandering to language. The work is to feel the world that is touching me.<br><br>This is neurodivesity as relation.<br><br>Reference:<br/><br>Madeline Gins. Helen Keller or Arakawa. Burning Books, 1994.</div>",
