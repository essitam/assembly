# CollatzVisualization
A p5js sketch to visualize the Collatz Conjecture. Inspired by Daniel Shiffman and The Coding Train

This sketch is inspired by Daniel Shiffman's future coding challenge on [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/). 
I do not knowwhat he is going to do but I saw on livestream that it is going to be about the Collatz Conjecture, 
so this is what I came up withon the topic. Looking forward to seeing what he makes next week.
