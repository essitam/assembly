  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>
    This is a prorgram written in <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> to explore the
    <a href="#collatz">Collatz Conjecture.</a> It allows you to input a number and then it plots the number's
    progression
    through rules of the Collatz Conjecture (see below). Each step is represented by a point on the
    canvas going from left to right. The hegiht of the point represents the value of the input
    of the Collatz function at that point. The <code>y</code>-axis is labeled but the <code>x</code>-axis is not

  <h1> What is the Collatz Conjecture?</h1>
  <p id="collatz">
    The Collatz Conjecture is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture">conjecture</a>
    in Mathematics that states for any positive integer <i>n</i> such that
    <i>n &gt; 1</i>, iterations through the Collatz function will eventually result in an output
    of 1.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Collatz function says that for any integer divisible by two, return that integer divided by 2;
    For all other integers return 1 more than 3 times that integer. In a program, such as Javascript,
    it would look something like this<br>
    <br>
    <code>
      function collatz(n) {<br>
        &nbsp;if (n % 2 === 0) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return n / 2;<br>
          &nbsp;} else {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;return (3 * n) + 1;<br>
            &nbsp;}<br>
      }<br><br>
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of how integers work, this function always returns an integer. Since it also
    accepts integers as input, it is always possible to feed the results of the Collatz function
    back into itself. This is what is meant by iterations through the Collatz function.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conjecture can be summed up as follows. For any integer <i>n</i> where <i>n &gt; 1</i>
    if you run <i>n</i> through the Collatz function and then take that result and run that
    through the Collatz function and then take that result and run <b>that</b> through the Collatz
    function, and so on and so on, eventually you will end up with 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    This could happen quickly. For example if you start with 2, 2 is divisible by 2, so you return
    2 / 2 which is 1. So that only takes one step.
  </p>
  <p>
    For 3, 3 is not divisible by 2 so you return 3 * 3 + 1 or 10. Now you put 10 through the
    Collatz function. Since 10 is divisible by 2 you return
    10 / 2 or 5. Now 5 goes through the function. Since 5 is not divisble by 2 you get 3 * 5 + 1
    or 16. Now 16 goes through the function and since it is divisble by 2 you get 8 which goes through
    the function and is divisble by 2 giving 4 then 2 then 1. You can see that this takes many more steps
    than 2 but still ends up at 1
  </p>
  <p>
    You can do this process for any valid integer and that is what is supposed to be shown by this sketch.
