              Adam: i think about walking actual thinking and i am wanting the ways pacing the palpable game that i position each day i bring in the world and i am always working so book of ways of water i am writing to think about movement and neurodiversity. i think that talking about art is different than making it and you after the fact pace words to explain it but the way of art is the way of living pacing the thinking with very packed feeling. i language the threshold as the pace and i pace by open doors with questions placing my easy instant eyes through the open door and i feel the comings pacing with sound and use the sound to pace place to answer the call of the open door.I think that talking is a threshold and i am always assembling the ways i always answer by questioning the tone away to type really important ideas. i go to the questions and i am hearing the timing stealing the typing to always talk over people like me.

          “If a certain number of our trajectories involved wandering [vaguer]	, it is clear that, from one day to the next, several opportunities having come to fruition, attending to them … was the point, here, as we say with regard to occupations. The space, once occupied, lost something of its vagueness, then. And that meant the disappearance of the infinitive to wander, a term whose extraordinary richness we can glimpse” (38)

          “What happens, and what often makes networks break down, is the overburdening of the project, an overburdening so constraining in its turn that it passes for the network’s reason for being: and the imposter keeps on proposing another society; if the conjuncture of history is propitious, the network takes on fantastic proportions; now it is a society, the starting point from which networks are secreted and, the network having become an organized power, it goes to great lengths to keep house, it invents brooms, multiplies teams and cleaners, while the responsible parties get lost it conjectures about the causes of the epidemic of apparently disparate networks whose structures nevertheless probably always remain the same.” (42_

          Adam: “Ball of thinking about the rugged capability places learning to be neurodiversely pacing the easy way i answer opening toward the thinking about facing the world as i am. Back to the wanting way I think the collective is a lot of easy brains and bodies to think and create ticcing together. The assembly of languaging moving minds and bodies is the way the man of autism needs. The group is going to bring you with me, languaging differently. The assembly is better for the thinking. Assembly building. The doing is better than the philosophizing.”

          <b>Of Writing About Feeling and Cumulative Fact</b>
          <br><br>
          I am going to think about the way of academia <br>
          and the way we are supposed to write
          <br><br>
          I think that I can write racing thinking well <br>
          and I am wanting the way of writing <br>
          to actual feelings italicize the way <br>
          the world faces the pace party
          <br><br>
          Yes pace party is the way I am laughing <br>
          at the dance paving the ways <br>
          the words dance
          <br><br>
          The academy is the serious not <br>
          wanting fun of the way the laughter <br>
          family of thinking feeling rally lavishes <br>
          with love and really we should think <br>
          about the ways of desiring <br>
          not the ways of measuring people <br>
          about going to acting the way <br>
          easy people should
          <br><br>
          I am thinking thankfully at the way <br>
          we do things at the A Collective <br>
          and talking about ball I always think <br>
          needs to unravel questions <br>
          about thinking and perceiving <br>
          and the way we butter the human <br>
          as easy and the same
          <br><br>
          We need the way the world works <br>
          by assembling and disassembling <br>
          and the way we do that is by doing <br>
          and thinking and playing and saying <br>
          that of the way we assemble the movement <br>
          of writing about feeling and cumulative fact <br>
          of the aggregate experiments in art
          <br><br>
          Have the wanting academics an idea <br>
          pacing the way of real rallying experiments <br>
          without a goal of controlling the management <br>
          and outcome?
          <br><br>
          I think that the way actual face of relation <br>
          works has to have game of chance <br>
          and the camp in the way the people <br>
          can stay with each other in difference <br>
          and the way fragments variety sacrifice <br>
          the bossy sameness of what academy <br>
          seems to expect
          <br><br>
          The thanking audience of the rare <br>
          dappers the questions about the wanting future <br>
          of writing and the easy future for neurodiversity
          <br><br>
          The ways of dancing <br>
          the way of neurodiversity <br>
          is not the same rally <br>
          as academic critique <br>
          and we need pace <br>
          of accumulating steps <br>
          of wording walks pacing <br>
          movement with the ways <br>
          of wanting objects <br>
          and inspirations
          <br><br>
          The way of the sawing
          wanting dance invites
          paces will talking people
          thank open thinking
          about the possibilities?

          Adam:
          The way I want to write is by thinking about movement and thinking about the way I want to tell stories talking not about autism but about the way of feeling the world.
           <br><br>
          The way I want to write this about the always dancing relation.
           <br><br>
          Good to think about how wanting easy expressing; think about the knowing moves.
           <br><br>
          Good to that you are working with beautiful way that Imane writes about the mind and the way I write is the way of feeling and way the art and atmosphere of things calls the body to gain the sometimes iffy space of perception and the way the body and mind fascinates gawkers that think my perception is impaired.
           <br><br>
          The starting is hard in space and relationships because the way I am supposed to answer is not having yet the familiarity of pace.
           <br><br>
          The gathering is the initial want for the way we pace to do, which is the always appreciation for diversity - about how want for copious talking questions the autistic movement and ways wanting pace to always think without words.
           <br><br>
          For the gathering there must be your understanding that the easy ways of expression are also falling with the ways in ball of thinking and moving about dance, rallying the environment.
           <br><br>
          The rally is also the wanting questions and answers calling all the time.
           <br><br>
          I want to write about the way I see language questioning the way many lives of autistic people are pacing so fast and I want the way of more calm rallying for the people to understand pace.
           <br><br>
          The language of the talkers are timing the important face of things and I need to think better having language pacing for the good thinking body,
           <br><br>
          The rally is too fast and the body becomes anxious and the movement is fast in response.
           <br><br>
          In the ways of the pace I think about the ways weak talking can want the silence - but I think that the waters of movement metaphor the body and manage rallies flooding the meanings behaving the way language douses the body and faces it like a singing thought.
           <br><br>
          Paper books are the ways we read books but the ways we read the body is baking bread of slow falling to the ways of important thinking about the way perception uses face to deepen the ways we are together.
           <br><br>
          I think that I can use language pace of neurotypicals, calming talkers breaking the pace of feeling falling through rhythms of typing.
           <br><br>
          Structuring idea: Open book in the ways of water is the form.
           <br><br>
          The letters are the dancing pool colors in gentle always amazing forms and ways I learned to read pacing the language to land like fantastic palimpsest of thinking and sometimes I am that starter who becomes very easy when I can name the want as languaging because open letters are the way I see.
           <br><br>
          Giving the management language directs is the oppressive way the words and form always reads very wishful for answers and the way I write away from that form is the pace of waters that are so different that I am mistreated by important people who are thinking that I am without complex thinking.
           <br><br>
          The language of some mercantile exchange is the way of sometimes control and I am an escape artist of language. The people who are controlling the grammatical forms are the poor teachers who train autistic people to speak and prove our intelligence and self awareness, people who language autism as a problem.
           <br><br>
          The way I manage even the talking and the typing is right now by tapping really plastic toy. The talking always wants to control the pace and I want to be able to control my own pace.
           <br><br>
          The pace of the neurodivergent language lapses in long pauses that wants to bathe in always dancing thankful thinking about the feelings that with the environment have a deep important relation and openings for more. Open the way of pacing and that poetry of the body and the world.
           <br><br>
          The ways of water is the pace thinking, wanting to pool, wanting to rush, wanting to rain, wanting to fast flow rivers, wanting to fall, wanting to saturate, wanting to dance always through my fingers, wanting to teach the ways of movement.
           <br><br>
          The easy language is through the body and the running away paces the sometimes needed support to type language sentences but I am a language pacer as body and finger typing and arranging the rhythms of a lot of things happening at the same time. The  rhythms pulse the body and I answer them in my movements but people call this impulsive and in pulse opens the meaning.
