<br> Call For:
<br> Assistant Director/Collaborator
<br> Full Time
<br> dis assembly: a neurodiverse arts collective
<br> Artscape Youngplace, Toronto.
<br></b>
</div>
<br> <b>About Us:</b>
<br>
<br> At <i>dis assembly</i>, the arts are our medium for relation, study and research-creation related to support. Some of our participants are non-speaking autistic people who write poetry and think deeply about perception and access in ways that challenge the pathology paradigm.
<br> We publish, present at universities and conferences, have exhibitions, collaborate in academia, make websites and explore other creative endeavours as they emerge through our experimental processes. We believe that our lives also constitute affirmative living research in a collaborative collective effort to access learning, contribution, relationships and creativity.
<br> In forming a resistance to the exclusions and barriers of neoliberalized educational systems and “developmental” models of human life, our collective work has created ongoing access rarely seen for non-speaking autistic people and others. Our collective creative work aims for the ongoing sustainability of support/care networks with an understanding of relational agency as it arises outside of institutional and ableist models of care.
<br> located at Artscape Youngplace in Toronto since January 2021.
<br>
<br> <b>About This Position</b>
<br>
<br> will be working alongside a team of committed neurodivergent academics, students, artists, researchers who are working in decentralized and radical approaches and neurodiverse processes for understanding the conditions and techniques that support neurodiversity.
<br> You will also assist and support one non-speaking autistic typer with other typers in their endeavours within the collective and in higher education. Learning the supported typing method is critical to collaboration and to understanding the topics of intrarelational movement, perception and expression. This form of communication informs our creative practices. You will be trained in supported typing techniques in order to provide access to communication, learning and social life.
<br> You will assist in organizing and participating in the activities and scheduling of the primary non-speaker alongside the Lead Support Assistant, and also assist in leadership of the collective, training new staff, finding new mentors and participants. This position will assume a critical role in envisioning and implementing our next steps toward fulfilling the overall vision of <i>dis assembly</i>.
<br> overlooked in “inclusive” practices and design. We are active in shifting assumptions about autism and in challenging ongoing exclusion and institutionalization of autistic people by providing access to communication, enriched learning, publication, presentations, exhibitions and access to university.
