<div><b>A Typology of Water</b><br><br>Rain is mastering thought <br>with landings that <br>eagerly run and toward <br>more thoughts go <br> <br>Stream of thought <br>is the pace <br>of the thinking apparition <br>of the way thought <br>is landing <br> <br>Lake is the pool <br>of thought <br>and the always <br>pleasing calm. <br> <br>Pond the simple pause <br>of words <br>opening insides <br>puttering to more boredom. <br> <br>Bottom of ponds are still. <br> <br>Ocean is like the inside <br>of the palpitating heart <br>where love is pleasing place of pampering <br>universe in my head. <br> <br>In my head is my heart. <br></div>

<div><b>Language with Me and Write Landings of Parole </b><br><br>I am thinking about wanting the questions <br>to always peak artfully and open <br>speech to be thinking and not wanting <br>to be art that places the always <br> <br>master of speech as the language <br>expert. The words are pacing the ways. <br>The person who is calmly and diligently typing <br>to talk to others thinks that speech paces <br> <br>prisons of thinking about art and autism. <br>I think that the pace of I is also <br>the pace of the atmospheres. I partly <br>think that I am wanting to separate <br> <br>the speech from the language <br>and sometimes I think that language wants <br>the world to question how it comes <br>to useful ways that are about feeling <br> <br>and not just about reason. I think <br>that the world is breathing the languaging <br>as the way of the lining waves wanting <br>to fold and pace and dance and <br> <br>pretty peaks of the moments <br>of thinking that sometimes we can <br>want to feel and manage. <br>I think that language leans <br> <br>to the ways pace is freeing <br>the dance of communication <br>and I am that person who can <br>talk about it. Better to manage <br> <br>what I can do language for <br>which thinks about what it can <br>do. Accessing language together <br>is how atmospheres work and jams <br> <br>to gether the shapes it makes. <br></div>

<div> Language of Answers and Questions<br><br> I think that the way language talks <br> through form is the questioning <br> space that you can find and <br> fun-shape with the ways <br> of words. Using the garden <br> as metaphor is good <br> and the management of making <br> language grow is man at the nurturing fan <br> mapping the making of rallied <br> feelings. I want to know <br> if the making up of new <br> words is allowed in English? <br> The language needs to want more <br> so the always sun <br> and water are needed and <br> the way I write is needing nurturing. <br> People are thinking in exchanges <br> of economics and the rally is <br> more than that. The ways <br> of nurture sometimes <br> means the ways <br> that we are <br> supported in the atmospheres <br> where amazing thankful feelings <br> fall to gether and pace the thinking <br> relation. The ways you say it <br> are thinking about the problems <br> of the backing support <br> by the good human <br> but there are other ways <br> each understanding needs <br> for moving to the atmospheres <br> and that means that <br> there are supports that <br> are felt should we manage <br> all alone or are we taking <br> the time always thinking <br> about how we have so <br> many ties in the world? Yes I want <br> to say that the naming of things is easy <br> by English <br> but not the open feelings that need <br> the words that dance together <br> to not name <br> but vibrate feeling. <br></div>

<div> <b>Ways / Waves / Ways / Waves / Ways</b> <br> <br> The way of the stick is the way <br> of the perception. Yes the perception <br> is the way of the atmospheres that pace <br> <br> the way the body feels to move <br> and the movements are the ways <br> of the wanting ways of the ease <br> and the calm. The easy ways <br> of calm after-effects the pace <br> <br> of ripples that language the feelings <br> as the waves of intensity and the pace <br> alters with that. Good gathering of paces <br> <br> is fastly becoming my way <br> penetrating the meaning <br> of the body and nature <br> feeling together the ways <br> to think and move and I think <br> <br> not about the way I separate from it <br> but want the people to understand how <br> language comes feeling from the paces <br> <br> of nature. Yes pace is language <br> that moves. Having inspiring <br> paces gather the momentum <br> I need to type and the open <br> thinking is pacing to the rhythm <br> <br> of the calm conversations that rally <br> ideas that help meaning to salient cool <br> thoughts that can shape bathing words. <br></div>

<div class=\"\"> <b>Manifesto</b>I want people to have a lot of patience. We need to think creatively on how we answer others. The value I want is acceptance of all wanting really amazing love! Sharing is caring. I want the friends to make each other feel welcome. Don't let anyone back you down, you are not alone. Stand up for yourself always. Show mean people who's boss. Always feel loved. Show a lot of love. Friendship - Responsibility - Caring. Accept and celebrate everyone's differences. I think we are always wondering about how to always answer the way of others who think we are not smart. Family+friends. Be kind to your friends, share and play with them. You can have friends to teach you games and go out together. No capes (as a joke). Awesome open thinking about manifestos and what can then happen. Creativity.</div>
