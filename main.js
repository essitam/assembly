    historymission: "<div class=\"\"> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> The A Collective: History </p> <p > The A Collective has emerged over time with ongoing exclusion of neurodivergent people in education and communal life. It is an outgrowth of The A School which was formed in 2016 as a creative school as a result of exclusion and shifted towards an artistic-philosophical curriculum aimed at discovering and supporting the conditions for neurodiversity to emerge and thrive. We become neurodiverse together, with an interdisciplinary group and approach to knowledge and also, for research creation and for work in creative pedagogical approaches. We are located in Toronto, Canada, originally co-founded by Estée Klar and Adam Wolfond, and proliferated by the A Collective group. Estée and Adam are mother and non-speaking autistic son, and have published the dissertation Neurodiversity in Relation: an artistic intraethnography at York University. Estée holds a PhD in Critical Disability studies, supported by the prolific thoughts and publications by Adam Wolfond and also, the collaboration with the participants at The A Collective which consist of other non-speaking people who type to communicate, educators, artists, poets and people who identify as neurodiverse or neurodivergent. The Collective emerged also from participating at SenseLab with Erin Manning and Brian Massumi at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. Their interest in relational art, philosophy and neurodiversity synchronized with our work in Toronto, that is, processual thinking and working together to find our own way of thinking and creating, together. Estée was awarded a SSHRC grant to complete the film S/Pace with Adam and the A Collective, and her former training as an artist and curator has brought other artists/mentors to also think with neurodivergent people to co-create and think more deeply about contribution and collaboration in order also to create supportive networks of care. The Collective grew to include younger participants who do not typically have access to self-determination with support. We view agency in this regard as collaborative. We are never unto ourselves but are mutually supported in a network of collective care that enables what we call agencement rather than agency. s </p> <p > The A Collective emerged from Klar’s work in creative schooling after becoming frustrated at ongoing exclusion of Adam. Schools would not allow his personal and communication support assistant in the classroom. In the public system in Toronto, it was a union issue in that only Educational Assistants were to provide the support, which removed the relational and training component of communication support (no EA is trained in facilitated communication or supported typing and AAC in general). We learned that relational support was also essential for navigating the many transitions and movements within the school environment, yet, EA’s were mostly temporary, and rotated among children. There was no permanence to individualized support. With a culture that supports ABA or IBI in Canada, the emphasis was on making the autistic person as independent as possible, thereby denying access to education in the meantime with the promise that this behavioural therapy would remediate. This remediation had to achieve these goals before inclusion into the classroom – before access to education was granted. </p> <p > We also noticed that the linear development model, born in the 1800’s to regulate education like a pipeline to factory work, began to create the assumption of normality, leading to the development of structural and systemic neurotypicality. That is, if you were diverse in any way, and could not follow developmental timelines, you were considered delayed, disorded, disabled. The social construction aspect of disability was enacted through the system of education and many were left behind – in institutions and later, into segregated school settings which is just another form of institutionalization. While the public education system created a tributary of special education, after the age of 21, many with disabilities were sent to the institutions and group homes anyway. </p> <p > Being an artist, Estee learned early about not belonging. The arts were never valued, except as entertainment, and unless popularized entertainment, largely underpaid. However, the arts accessed another mode of expression and communication outside of economic value-profit models. This became a way of thinking in non-economic, neoliberalized terms, as well as for people who made diverse contributions to society. </p> <p > Looking to the creative schooling model when she established The A School, located in Forest Hill Village in Toronto mainly for Adam, she had a vision to enact caring and creative pedagogies that supported neurodiverse ways of movement and expression. Rather than thinking of this as accommodation and access practices alone, these became autistic-led practices that emerged in relation with objects, with other people, within spaces that revealed how spaces are apprehended and perceived, and how movement processes helped the body to settle within them. The tables and chairs dissapeard and on-the-floor couches and pillows took over. Lap desks replaced table surfaces. </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Assembly: A Laboratory for Neurodiverse Experimentation for Relation </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We are </p> <p > a collaborative learning and supportive assemblage dedicated to neurodiversity and shifting research creation and knowledge </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We begin </p> <p > with the premise that experimentation and process is at the heart of experience and collaboration, we attune to the conditions that support and proliferate neurodiversity </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> We move </p> <p > between philosophy, language and art for relanguaging and conception of neurodiverse movement and pace through relation, affect and materials (what we have named relationshapes) </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> What moves us </p> <p > diversity and relation bringing art, philosophy, critical disability studies together to rethink new modes of life and new forms of value </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Who it addresses </p> <p > • all ages and any level of education, neurodiverse or neurotypical who wish to engage in mutual support and learning as a life-long process of social engagement • for those interested in networks of sustainability for support, education, care • students and teachers looking for a transdisciplinary, neurodiverse milieu to supplement their studies and interested in learning explorative techniques • community workers, caregivers, supporters, artists, teachers and activists wishing to explore neurodiversity and collaborative creation to expand their domain of practice </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Keywords: </p> <p class=\"wobblyText\"> Relation, Neurodiversity, Research-Creation, Sustainability, Conviviality, Process </p> <br><p class=\"wobblyText\"> ANTI-MISSION STATEMENT: </p> <p > The A Collective exists as a creative collaborative space where relation is at the core of study for the purposes of shifting disability and inclusion policy in Canada. We utilize arts-based methods for creative works inventing with neurodiversity. We work towards the enactment of inclusion, rethinking how inclusion has been deployed in Canada, revolving around existing normative systems. We provide social groups, reading groups and alternative learning strategies informed by autistic people. </p> </div>",
    walkingdrawing: "<div class=\"walkingdrawing\"><h1>walking-drawing machines</h1><div >In 2016-2017, at The A School Collective in Toronto, Adam Wolfond expressed a desire to capture his movements. Adam began with a desire to walk by placing a GoPro camera on various parts of his body. Later, with his artistic mentors, Estée Klar and Kyla Brown, Adam explored mark making and various cartographies documented in film and drawing. He created them by constructing \“walking-drawing machines\” that he attached to his body to reflect the hand-stim, jumping, the walk itself. Adam writes on being able to walk: \“I base my pace on you\” to describe his sensitivity to the affective milieu - its cues - and how movement and relational are co-compositional.</div><div>The house is my body in the amazing movement of walking. In the pattern of my body I am single pattern of walking. Walking happens in my good head. The way I walk in line is timed with my noises. The walk is when I think the most. Rhythm is coming in my pleasing noises. In my noises I try to line my pace. The way of walking is also falling. It is in line with my having to think about a mommy always walking with me. Thinking about walking can also be difficult within the boy’s very busy environment (Adam, 2016).</div><div id=\"links\"><a

Pace is the way Adam says he \“answers\” space - of tapping toys and waving sticks, or tapping them on his wrist. Adam declares that \“I can see the blast of the whole not like you\” and that the visual field is always moving. Waving sticks and tapping/squeezing rubber bath toys are as visually pleasing as much as self-adaptive in order to move and transition through space itself. Adam writes:<br><br>The body is always having movements and I am mobile having objects with me all the time. Boy needs objects to move. I see the objects and focus on assembled parts in the environment like a house and not the door and because I don’t see the door I manage by doing lots of amazing things like pacing my movements to the same way as my assistants. I see the whole but not the same whole as other people. They are not able to see the blast of the whole like I do. They can see the school but I can see everything gathering in the hallway moving; the forging movements of movement. Van Gogh is not like how I see but I manage moments of movement like a painter who is landing the boy’s thoughts and perceptions.<br><br>A collaboration with myself, artist Ellen Bleiwas and filmmaker, Eva Kolcze, Adam explores his relation with sticks and rubber bath toys as they \“answer\”  the space or the pace of \“fast talkers.\” Ticcing as a way to feel the world denotes proprioceptive diversity as Adam notes that,<br><br>[h]ands other than legs space good feelings because my hands are the name of mastery other than the legs. The away feeling is hard to manage, and the hands are the way I can walk. The away feeling is the way of naming the way my legs feel and I do not feel them. I want you to understand that I am always trying to feel.<br><br>Adam alludes to what Arakawa and Gins name vitality, a way of spacing space that is not self-same as in walking with legs. Madeline Gins noted that \“in order for something to be thought of, or for an object to be perceived, something (some event) will need to be adhered to, no matter how briefly\” (Gins, 1994, 10). She uses the term to \“cleave\” as to adhere to, and simultaneously \“be cut apart\” (9). \“How do I move? I can only move by eating up or dissolving where I am. I (anyone) pull in with a bright gulp what is to come next (10-11). When the hesitating, ticcing, the body also seeks to land towards its next move.  \“What happens to your position when I move, when I move a wall, or change the angle of the floor? What happens when the sidewalk always feels it is moving? (Ibid). In the hesitation, the tic, the wave of the stick, the tap of the toy, Adam cleaves and prepares to move forth. \“I can feel my arms and legs but not the ground beneath my feet,\” he writes. Adam writes towards a leaky sense of self in the world, a \“thinking-feeling through a body that is always moving\” (Adam); a way of becoming. Where Arakawa and Gins experiment with bodies in space as a form of vitality (of life-living) \“to reconfigure oneself so that you can stay alive ongoinginly\” (16), Adam’s vitality is through movement in relation - as hands, twirls, tics, taps and even my hand on his back to initiate movement when he cannot. Adam:<br><br>Ticcing through the world is like touching it… I feel the world too much so open bothersome work is to feel inside pandering to language. The work is to feel the world that is touching me.<br><br>This is neurodivesity as relation.<br><br>Reference:<br/><br>Madeline Gins. Helen Keller or Arakawa. Burning Books, 1994.</div>",
    poetry: "<div id=\"poetry\">With his fellow poet-mentor, Chris Martin of <a href=\"http://www.unrestrictedinterest.com/\">Unrestricted Interest</a>, Adam put his finger to iPad to write two books of poetry, to be released in late 2019. Adam’s writing is, as he says, “like water,” and his reflections on experience, perception and spacetime flow in his writing. Adam’s writings are sensory and visual, lending to artistic work. His poems move us and also become the material for study in our art practice.<br><br><b><i>I can accept my artful way of writing but I want wall of speaking to tall order to come down.

    improvisation: "Improvisation Work in Studio<br>We bring many ideas, movements, readings in studio with us. These photos show how a relational artistic collaboration emerges utilizing objects of interest to Adam - sticks and rubber bath toys. We are attentive to our movements, the way our moves affect one another, other noises and affects in the room, the soreness of our bodies during repetitive moves. Adam: “Habits are in my way of movement and sometimes I feel like using them to make bandwidth of thinking about how some habits can’t be changed. I want bandwidth to the larger acceptance of my movements to think about how you are with autistic people.” We invent with these moves, with objects, as the co-compositional, improvisational process. We rethink habits with the attunement to the transitional; when the body always feels the field’s incipient movement.<br><br><b><i> Art uses things to assemble meaning and amazing art pays. But this is not free art. Art can mean a lot and can be a lot of things. A resting point people want is a way that we can express in typing, a reality with outward thoughts. Art is the way of lots of easy feelings. Art doesn’t necessarily pander to minds to land meaning. Good art is about really open ideas. Art is profound because it ignores intention. Feeling freedom is the most important thing in my art. Art is a feeling in my body. I want art to move toward tough and terrific feelings.

    reformingdx: "Reforming DX<br>Adam and I began by cutting up old diagnostic reports. Adam wrote about how the “language of autism” writes him off as a non-thinking person. As a mother, I have been writing about our negative experiences through the process of having to obtain a diagnosis in order for services or to be identified for school. The process of diagnosis is lead by psychologist charged with finding disability under the assumption that this will be helped or remediated. Testing occurs over two days using tests to diagnose for autism and other tests that analyze typical motor planning and verbal skills; these are to analyze intelligence. There are no tests designed for specifically autistics (do we need them?) and for they way they communicate and move because tests are designed to measure against neurotypicality. The early process of identification for us has been useless but for others, we understand it can be liberating to know that their “difference” can be attributed to something. We believe this need for identification has more to do with acceptance than obtaining help as the system of help for autistic children is intended to eradicate autism. This leaves a lifetime impression of having to keep up, of feeling inadequate as Adam writes always of wanting to talk like others to be accepted. We examine the assumptions that presume the talking-walking, humanist subject, the neurotypcial, dominates as the preferred body and how thinking about our own movements can be transformative and to shift the way we view the human, and how we become in the world. Instead of asking how we should produce art, movement, or “proper” ways of socialization, we ask how we already do so as the conditions that support neurodiversity.<br><div id=\"links\"> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6684%2B%281%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6684%2B%281%29.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6685.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6685.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6686.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6686.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6688.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6688.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6691.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6691.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6692.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6692.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6693.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6693.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6694.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6694.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6696.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6696.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/IMG_6698%2B%281%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/reforming-dx/thumbnails/IMG_6698%2B%281%29.jpg\"></a></div>",

    likewateriam: "Like Water I Am<br><br>To create is to stim. Adam reclaims the movements that neurotypicality has framed as maladaptive and that are targeted for remediation (and eradication). The autistic body is often forced to stay still, despite Adam’s prolific work on movement as necessity: “thinking is a feeling through a body that is always moving.” Movement s/paces the environment; the environment is the ecology of people, places, things, ideas. Adam’s “stimventions” rethink the body and its moves as creative. These are the excess that neurotypicality erases in its quest to make sense of autism, to explain its moves to meaning. Adam doesn’t write about his movements as representative, as cause and effect. His writings on movement - tic and tap, tic and stick (see his poetry, coming soon) - never close down one singular meaning for the stim. Rather, the stim’s movement has multiple effects. The stim belongs to the multiple, where one meaning never lands for long.<br><br><b><i>Water is awesome cascade of my thoughts like a smooth game of forging feeling.

Elizabeth Grosz, citing Henri Bergson, suggests that attunement is intuition that attends to the durational. The durational is where difference in degree emerges: “Intuition… is a ‘shadow’, a ‘swirling of dust’, more than a concrete and well-formed concept. It is an emergent and imprecise movement of simplicity that erupts by negating the old, resisting temptations of intellect to understand the new in terms of the language and concepts of the old”

    notebooks:"Notebooks<br><br>When I began my PhD study and collaboration with Adam, I realized that drawing concepts was helpful in order think through the philosophical ideas as a practice. It is a way of thinking with movement the way Adam once wrote “thinking is a feeling through a body that is always moving.” Following Deleuze & Guattari, this artistic/intraethnographic collaboration works between the molar/molecular: “The world as multiplicity, as constituted by movements of differences in intensity” (O’Sullivan, 31). Relation and its assembled meshworks are in perpetual motion. Language, as in writing for academia, as an example, asks me to suspend the movement. It is within a creative artistic process that we have developed an intraethnography as the intrasubjective collaboration that questions the production of subjectivity as coming from one voice. We also question identity-thinking that belongs to the articulation of the humanist subject.<br><br>A PhD requires new concepts to be created which is difficult in the process of writing traditionally, so I gravitated towards this artistic practice with Adam to understand rhythm, movement, relation, duration as important concepts in the discussion of “difference” and collaboration. Difference as duration, from Henri Bergson, are also affective events, and what happens around them are the excess that the “coherent” academic paper alone delimits. Adam and I both resist writing that is instrumental in nature (this instrumentality when it comes to autism is to be methodologically prescriptive in terms of remediation and cure). We also refer to our artistic practice as our life; it is has arisen from the way we move and survive in the world, outside of educational systems that have excluded us both as mother and son. These journals are daily reflections of collective readings and discussions with Adam and other readings we engage together.<br><br>Adam and I, often with members of The A Collective, bring readings or “situations” derived from others as an “enabling constraint” to begin. We might, for example, think around the concept of repetition and how that is taken up in various fields. In the behavioural psychology fields (also adopted by other clinical/therapeutic regimes), for example, repetition and obsessive interests are pathologized. Repetition is too simply characterized as behavioural (maladaptive) rather than as pleasurable, necessary, adaptive, generative. In the development of a skill, repetition is a practice for the development of technique. Repetition is also mastery. Repetition brings something into existence. Repetition spaces space (as in proprioception). It lands and moves again. Repetition stabilizes, sort of, because in repetition there are always new movements and affects coming forth, in the field of relation. We think deeply about repetition in terms of how it is positioned as mastery and human, and then move it toward autistic repetition outside the pathology paradigm.<br><br>Reference:<br><br>O’Sullivan, Simon.

    mobilewriting:"Mobile Writing<br>We think about form, proper grammatical form, language that can delimit expression rather than move with it. Writing aims to parse experience whereas neurodiverse experssion immerses within it, making writing a movement process. Adam describes movement with language as it is happens in the moment of writing. Collective writing also moves with affective forces, other voices, readings. We are always immersed despite an assumption that writing happens alone; that we are independent authors. This immersion is more pronounced in Adam’s writing, as his words resonate feelings and relations, rather than explicate them.<br><br>Using a typewriter in this work, I let myself make mistakes, thinking about thinking itself, and I find myself stumbling; I am anxious about being “correct.” I think too much about the movement to hit the right key, and I hesitate. When I type too fast, I hit the wrong keys. Thinking about movement simultaneously with the thoughts I think I want to express is difficult to think about separately, but that is how Adam describes the difficulty of movement. My thought-goal is entwined with the present moment of movement-moving toward the future sentence. My thoughts shift as I write; the goal of expression is lost in the process of movement-typing to become something more; the writing is affected by the moments and feelings I am within. I then look at the writing itself, in its material form; typing without correction. This is the writing-event expressed as it was expressing. I am thinking about this along with Adam’s writing about how hard it can be to type as he discusses how he has to think deliberately about his movements to the keyboard, and with relational affective collaboration, or support, he brings expression to form.<br><div id=\"links\"> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/F19B013C-BA62-4A2C-9138-C7AC14E900E8.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/F19B013C-BA62-4A2C-9138-C7AC14E900E8.jpeg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6233.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6233.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6234.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6234.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6647%2B%282%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6647%2B%282%29.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6677%2B%281%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6677%2B%281%29.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6682.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6682.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6683.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6683.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6699.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6699.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_6700.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_6700.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7691.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7691.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7692.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7692.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7693.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7693.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7698.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7698.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7700.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7700.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/IMG_7702.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/mobile-writing/thumbnails/IMG_7702.jpg\"></a></div>",
    relationshapes: "Relationshapes<br><br>Relationshapes are affective movement drawings. Also cartographies of contrapuntal movement, these drawings reflect how space and relation affect the way we move. This is not directed movement, not coerced or choreographed. This is simply attunement to how we move and a way to think about how support is always mobile and undulating. I also drew the affect, however, of movement that was directed from therapists and schools.<br><br>These drawings emerged as the the non-written contribution to rethinking how we tend to engage with autistic people. I was attentive to the professional team meetings; where the therapists dictate strategies within the pathology paradigm. Also, where there is a team leader on a typical autism team or in a school meeting, the hierarchy is felt. The way we must engage with the autistic person in the clinical sense, becomes a prescription and a strategy as opposed to a mutual collaboration. The autistic is the object toward which these methodologies are enacted. The way curriculum and classrooms are run are also directing hierarchical “bank-deposit” education.<br><br>Fernand Deligny’s work (1913-1996) resembles this; where he mapped the movements of autistics at his commune in Cevennes, France. Deligny did not aim to rehabilitate the autistic. This collaboration with Adam extends Deligny’s work in that Adam contributes to the way he feels and the way he wants to collaborate and also, participate in his own education. Drawing affective movement was a way for me to think of collaboration as mutual and also, to think about how movement cues movement.<br><br>I am a lot of the time thinking about how to move. I want the art to have a feeling of the boy’s assembling of the really tough movement. I want good art about movement to give people the ideas of the way I don’t always answer in words. I think that people ask questions to assembled ideas that always please them and they hope sometimes that their questions are backed by my typing. My art opens understandings of autism that feels relations with good people and my environment. Activating movement for me is because of the support the body has feeling with another body. I want art about movement to give people ideas about the way I don’t answer in words. Can a good body feel without another body?

    autismtoinclusion: "Autism to Inclusion Film",
    recipesfortheopen:"Recipes for the Open<br><br>As a mother to a non-speaking autistic person who types to communicate and who I support in relation to type (he writes poetry, books, journal articles…), I am often asked for a method to teach supportive typing (also called facilitated communication or assistive communication). I find that providing support as a methodology is difficult because it tends to be deductive, and support is about relation, not about reductive steps for relation. It is, rather, always a-stepping. The way Adam, my son, and I have come to think of relation is open; an always moving and shifting relation. When our relation is parsed in the dis/abled scheme - as the teacher and learner - I become falsely viewed as the able-bodied speaker and my son, the disabled non-speaker; my role in this framework becomes hierarchical and rehabilitative rather than mutual and collaborative. Instead, our work together envisions the transience of bodies as the process of relation, not as fixed or separate. As Adam is never the same each day, so too the environment, situation, my body, also changes from day to day. We become with the environment and with each other: an ecological body. Adam writes extensively on the incorporeal - the non-human, invisible world of affective relation, where objects and environment provide just as much a support (if not more than human support) - a way of proprioceptive aligning within it. In our relationship with each other and the world, we attend (a word co-opted by behaviorism) with rhythms, feelings, ways of moving-aligning. Adam refers to this as pace which remains central to thinking about transitions as movement; the intervals and durations consist of the “unfiltered detail” that is not otherwise subtracted from autistic perception. These thresholds, particularly when “fast-paced like talkers” move, can become difficult to navigate, provoking anxiety particularly when the expectation is to move and speak quickly. It is akin to how we think of a world that is architected for the able body; a body preferred for capital (efficient) production. This mode of production and of being, thinks of value as that which can extract or subtract the excess. The autistic body has been imagined within a pathology paradigm as excessive.<br><br>Adam writes much about an attunement to the “background” which is also the foreground of every movement-moment - “in my face” all the time, he writes. He cannot excise the excess but rather lives within it, perhaps a neurotypical lack. He has accustomed himself to facing differently, peripherally, with toy tapping, pattering to pattern pace - to cope in a fast-paced, neoliberal world. Pace is, therefore, never exclusive to two bodies (the duo, the “inter”, often centres on the human relation as separate from the ecology), but is in relation with various pulses, resonances, vibrating objects that are both visible and invisible, and above all, felt. We name this the intrarelation to think about all that move with us - which our otherwise neurotypical culture envisions as pathological, useless, valueless, disordered. We have adopted the term attunement rather than attention (that strict, behaviorist word that invokes how attention ought to be demonstrated) to think about these forces and intensities that move us for a way to think about not only the how of autism, but the how of relation.During the writing of my dissertation, someone suggested I write “recipes.” This is asked of me all the time, and any of Adam’s other support assistants and teachers will tell you that we spend several months together before we even begin the supported typing, because bodies need to become accustomed to the nuances of movement. Bodies need to understand bodies through movement. My resistance to writing the step-by-step instruction manual is based on the premise that supportive/facilitative communication is much more than method; it israther, a way of movement that thinks beyond the instructional steps. Rather, it is like thinking about how dancing moves us. We are bodies dancing collaboratively in the complex field of relation. This is not to say that supportive typing cannot be taught - indeed there are good teachers for it - but most of which is actually taught is this understanding of motor planning differences, idiosyncratic movement, autism as perceptual and movement diversity, and above all, an understanding of autism outside the pathology paradigm. I need to add also that people who type to communicate are more than “spellers” (a term I’ve seen recently adopted), but express the texture of relation. This might be expressed as a synaesthetic relation with language (synaesthesia, simply put, is a merging of the senses like hearing colour - but this is still far too simple). I feel this needs to be said because the way autistics come to language is different than the utilitarian use of it. This way of expression elides the objective/subjective narrative but instead immerses in language as movement coming to expression. Rather than pointing and requesting, Adam could read before he could stand up; he simply delighted in words - beyond their utility - recently writing that “words vibrate colours and sounds.” I’d never before witnessed someone come to language on his own before he could walk, as he hoisted himself up on the side of his playpen to read the titles of bookspines on the adjacent shelf (he can speak words). Later, the way he learned to type became rich in associations and gerunds - what he calls “verbing”. Language to Adam is everything as a languaging that moves. As such, we merge poetic and artistic/movement practices such as walking and working with water - a theme Adam is presently working on for his own book.<br><br>Typing, telling, narrating is a subtractive exercise - so difficult to excise that which moves neurodiverse perception! Non-speaking typers like Adam grasp-toward-through (see: Manning, 2020) that I have come to think of the way Adam not only writes sentences, but moves, and sometimes struggles through transitions. We think of every movement as transitory so therefore moving from one point to the next, including moving a limb, is difficult. This is the essence, also, of support; an attunement to these differences, this registering of all within the transition all at once. Adam recently wrote that everything is always moving, echoed from an earlier poem he wrote “The Walls Are Never Still” (2019). It is as much our focus and interest as his struggle to bring back to the field these otherwise excluded, excised movements from expression such as writing and art. Once trained to excise the affective, to communicate effectively and efficiently, all that is part of experience can be lost. It can take years for writers to regain what comes to Adam naturally (I use words of “nature” cautiously). When we subtract the excess, we also subtract all that constitutes relation, and artistic processes seek to regain and express these experiences which cannot always be written down. In the neoliberal scheme, relation becomes a manufactured, utilitarian concept of how we are supposed to act and express within particular environments, and as we see, “professionalized” interactions fear litigation and so parse the relation even more (think doctor/patient relations and you have it). Neurotypicality parses relation and puts the human and language above all life - the top of the chain - marking human life as intelligent, agential, independent. Language is therefore not only instrumentalized, but weaponized against beings who express otherwise, who don’t make rational sense of sense. Attunement, however, pays attention to the the ever-shifting nanoseconds of movement, “calls” that dance our bodies; a dance vital not only for survival, but for thriving in an otherwise ableist world that excludes excessive, exuberant, moving…autistic bodies. As suggested, Adam articulates this movement as “answering the calls” within the space, to other moving bodies, be they human or non-human. In effect, this is the more than human to which we attune.<br><br>In the dissertation, I write that Adam has influenced my way of thinking and also writing. It must be written how autistic people like Adam have shaped us and our ways of thinking and expressing. Little is written by the one perceived as the “facilitator” of the way the autistic person shifts the way we think, write, support. This is a mutual collaboration perhaps made more evident because Adam is autistic and the idea that he can influence me is perhaps a new concept (the onus is typically on the autistic to prove their independence from their facilitator). We suggest that collaboration happens all the time and that the independent (able) artist, author, inventor is the myth of neoliberalism, and also, of the “mastery” that has come to infiltrate the art world. This way of thinking manifests in the arrangement of neurotypicality - an arrangement that tells us how to move, to think, walk, behave, sit still, talk, be… and express ourselves as sole arbiters/authors/makers. This thinking linear, developmental, methodological - and wants easy-to-use recipes. It wants Adam to write about his autistic experience in the language of neurotypicality and its forms while he has otherwise insisted: “I don’t want to answer stupid questions about autism […] I want to move to express myself.” Perhaps the “stupidity” of the questions wrests in the whys of autism - and not the deeper questions about diverse experience - the hows.<br><br>Adam writes, “art is the open way of telling.” Opening is the theme of his work - as wayfaring wanderlines that - when we think, work, play, repeat and attend to them - become a plane of consistency that emerges from the disassembling of narrative, rationality, and other nefarious acts intelligence. This is not working with a pre-planned goal to make art. Art is the open, processual movement with materials, walking with the world. These recipes for the open emerge post-dissertation, post-PhD defense, and after my mother suddenly passed away from cancer. One of the first things I took away from her apartment was her recipe box. She had not only collected recipes that left holes and gaps in the instructions - that allowed for improvisation - but also notes, pieces of drawings that she saved from when I was a child. What can the end result of a cake be when there is a timing instruction or an ingredient piece missing? What can I recall of how it should be and how does my memory move in the act of making? What about shift in temperature, the make of the oven, the difference of pressure and velocity of a spoon stirring in a vat of dough? All of these moments, movements, durations, intensities can render a different result each time. My mother’s little box of recipes contained not the step-by-step guide for living and making, but - whether she knew it or not - the open suggestions for it; for experimentation. A box full of memories never the same twice.Simultaneous with the playful poetic impulses of Adam’s expression in language, he is involved in creating “walking algo-rhythms” - a fluxus-like mode for thinking about moving in the neurodivergent city that is already there - a movement that saturates his way of not only “languaging autism” and the world, but an invitation for us to attune to the world that is otherwise subtracted and ignored in the quest for fast-paced, efficient movement and “functionality” for production. The neurodivergent city that is already here. The typed text derived from experimentation on a typewriter which I write about in the dissertation - an experiment with hesitating movement, mistakes, slanting as Adam writes about ticcing, hesitation and paused movement as part of his own typing experience and language-making. The marks made in charcoal have long been with me, marks as movement of thought, also from my Relationshapes series that thought about not the why of movement with Adam, but the how - affective cartographies for thinking about movement and relation.<br><br>So much collaboration, sharing, blur. As Adam shares so much of himself, of his way of moving in the world, his way of thinking about the environment as support, his way of feeling and “seeing,” and with my time spent “mutlitasking” as artist, scholar, mother, facilitator, I attempt to manifest this step in our process with recipes for the open as yet one more movement for anyone to use, and participate. Forthcoming: Adam’s own set of poetic walking algo-rhythms. Creative synergies working together. All of our work is processual and experimental; it is never finished. This is, rather, the way we think and live together. The work we make is never the art itself but a process of thinking and moving toward the conditions that support neurodiversity. This is not art as object but art to think about neurodiverse ways of living. Adam’s lexicon emerges, with ways and paces as his, our, interest, gesturing and inviting many ways to move, perceive, live. The ways that Adam has moved my thinking and feeling, my attunement, to think poetically - in many ways - and above all, open. We might experiment with this as a neurofluxbox of objects and ideas that others can play and experiment with, to open to the neurodivergent city that is already there - a project in collaboration also with Ellen Bleiwas, Jessa Polson and Chris Martin. Or perhaps it will emerge in another form. Already brewing are poetic anti-directions and zoom calls we share walking experiences together. Let me just say that neuro is never used here in the neuroreductionist sense, but moves with the neurodiverse notion that our bodyminds are diverse among humans - that there are many ways to perceive and express in the world beyond neurotypical imaginings that confine our thinking and making. There are many ways to be, share and collaborate together. This is a new way of thinking about mutual support and care.References:<br><br>Erin Manning. For A Pragmatics of the Useless.

    repetition: "Repetition<br><br>Repetition is characterized negatively regarding autistic movement. Yet, artists have stressed the importance of repetition for movement. At the A Collective, Adam explores his own repetition with objects thus creating new orientations towards how repetition is envisaged and what constitutes the intentional in art-making. We think with Marina Abromovic here: “You can start with any object and create an energy field around it again and again through ritual… because repetition of the same thing over and over again generates enormous power. Old cultures know this. That’s why they base their entire ritual structure on repetition” (1998, Artist Body).<br><br>Notions of intention and mastery are challenged within the rubric of humanism through characteristics such as independence, agency, skill. In contrast, autistic bodies characterized within the pathology paradigm as unaware or unable to produce work independently. In a collaborative practice that is mutually supportive, these notions have little meaning, as everything is agential. Following a vital materialist approach and Bergson’s notion of duration and freedom as not of choice but with the freedom to act (as in expression), we reorient these concepts as the movement of life and with objects that is always transformative. We are interested in repetition as a co-composition and a relational mutual becoming, and also, with ways of “landing” or “answering space” (Adam). With a sense of humour, Adam inverts the notion of mastery when he writes “I am master of my own movements,” to discuss how he needs to become in the world, and also as speaking back to those who problematize his movements:<br><br>I am master of my own movements. I am always creating an energy that is really important to music my amazing good-feeling body. I feel the good earth vibrations. I am really excited to think about easy action and I feel that I sometimes do things that are repetitive. I have a hard time making movements at the same rhythm and I can’t move like others but I try and I am boy of desire to join. I like to dance but I am not coordinated. I think that movement is a way to think about the way I can think and open myself to being in the places that are like sounds of painful noise that are not easy. I am amazing pattern of movements that are placing me at the centre of calm.<br><br>The object is something I make important each time I use it. The repeated movements of objects is making them about more than they are.

This program is co-curated by CDCC Education and Accessibility Coordinator, Emily Cook, and Tangled Art + Disability Director of Programming, Sean Lee and represents the next level in our ongoing series of programs providing opportunities for curators and artists to consider new and more collaborative aesthetic and conceptual approaches to accessibility within and beyond the gallery context.<br><br>ACCESS IS LOVE and LOVE IS COMPLICATED takes inspiration not only from disability activist Mia Mingus’ idea that accessibility should be understood as an act of love, but riffs on a pop cultural understanding that love is complicated—and thus, if we truly wish to move towards an accessible future then we must embrace the frictions of it. A lived experience that is often as political as it is relational, disability is a springboard from which access is entangled in the political alterities of our bodies; how they move, navigate and shape the world.<br><br>We–disabled people–are, as Kelly Fritsch notes, effective agents of world building and dismantling towards more just relations. But as we dismantle the world and work towards access as an act of love, we must also recognize that this act is complicated. Crip, Mad, Spoonie, and Deaf people are woven together in a tangled through-line of embodied difference, but more often than not our experience of negotiating access (or lack thereof) is performed alone. This is because our experience of disability has been something we’ve been told is located exclusively in our bodies. As we move towards access as love, and our understandings of disability shift towards relational, social and political frameworks, access, like love, becomes complicated—but in a good way. In the words of Carrie Bradshaw, this kind of love is “ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can’t-live-without-each-other love.”<br><br><div id=\"links\"> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/1-_MG_0071.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/10-_MG_0101.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/11-_MG_0064.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/12-_MG_0066.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/13-_MG_0056.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/14-_MG_0061.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/15-_MG_0050.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/16-_MG_0052.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/17-_MG_0054.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/18-_MG_0067.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/19-_MG_0070.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/2-_MG_0042.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/3-_MG_0075.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/4-_MG_0076.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/5-_MG_0077.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/6-_MG_0078.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/7-_MG_0079.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/8-_MG_0086.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/accesislove/9-_MG_0087.jpg\"><img src=\"<\"></a></div><br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0j76Ggv8i4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WiuVv4WCptc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    rubberbath:"Toys are tapped and squeezed and their colour musics symphonies for Adam who writes that he hears colour. Adam has thought with toys to build new spaces, to think about synaesthesia. Toys also facilitate movement as oscillators. Thinking of objects as oscillators is to think of moving through the thresholds, or transitions that are continuous for Adam as the relational field is always mobile. Excerpted from Adam’s poetry:<br><br>I tic like using tall/ideas to tap my way/through the space of the outside world and I sometimes/game the space/like a backward spiral that/tries to find its way.<br><br>The body is always having movements and I am mobile having objects with me all the time. Boy needs objects to move. I see the objects and focus on assembled parts in the environment like a house and not the door and because I don’t see the door I manage by doing lots of amazing things like pacing my movements to the same way as my assistants. I see the whole but not the same whole as other people. They are not able to see the blast of the whole like I do. They can see the school but I can see everything gathering in the hallway moving like the forging movements of movement. Van Gogh is not like how I see but I manage moments of movement like a painter who is landing the boy’s thoughts and perceptions” (Adam, 2018).<br><br>These important toys make their way into an artistic practice as they do our daily lives. Adam never leaves home without them.<br><div id=\"links\"> <a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/17098415_10154216534516218_9080947102833124600_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/17098415_10154216534516218_9080947102833124600_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/27657470_10155133157796218_2077413747459125723_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/27657470_10155133157796218_2077413747459125723_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/29573215_10155288911431218_2535219005489214085_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/29573215_10155288911431218_2535219005489214085_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/39502869_10155644444521218_6184649887154438144_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/39502869_10155644444521218_6184649887154438144_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/39502869_10155644444521218_6184649887154438144_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/45040034_10155808780171218_4698030305779384320_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/49292649_10155963956581218_616022280182431744_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/49292649_10155963956581218_616022280182431744_n.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/49508083_10155964336746218_6802297941307424768_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dis-assembly.ca/assets/assets/bathtoys/thumbnails/49508083_10155964336746218_6802297941307424768_n.jpg\"></a></div>",
