I think that I am easy when I can write 
although I want people to always accept 
that I also want to move

Collected 




I love the way the logs always 
feel like warm rottings
of the line pressing my really 
questions of the want 
for ballast balling my awesome 
arms. I am easy to very 
much be collected when I answer 
with the logs and I am 
really about to love myself with them.

I Lose Myself in the Sticks




I am thinking a lot about the way I lose 
myself in the sticks and how I am 
thinking amazing things pale and without 
always the music but the always 
making movement 


I am thinking the language is the always
moving sticks that pass through
the air 


I think that I find my way in movement
and I am always managing 
the malware pacing through the network 
of making noise


It sounds like away yes open and going
nowhere


________________


I Manage to Language in the Air




Yes I am airing language of 
sticks and space and 


land my body’s easy way with 
them. Yes I air wanting 


questions with movement and
good and questions always


are the easy pace of 
rhythm. Yes the open air


is the amazing way that 
the questions are. Really dance


of rhythm thinks away 
falling it always is naming 


the way pace says that Adam 
must amazing and answer.


Yes I am airing my thinking 
as air is wistful. Yes I air openly 


and open the way of answering.
Yes the air paces language


as language paces inside of 
me and I am good at making it 
 
always dance and move so
I can gather myself and base


my pace on the movement.

Correspondence 




Using no is a sometimes 
unusual way to say I am 
feeling overwhelmed. 


I think that real insides 
are objects that come
alive and feel fascinating 


and fall into amazing 
always language. Big 
ideas are the answers 


about feelings and yes
the god lays in fast 
game inside the subjects 


of objects. God is 
the answer, but feelings 
are the appreciation


for living in the world. 
Chance of that yes 
is starting thinking about 


feelings and the way
we go today to the ice
age is the way time


sends easy messages.
The god has the meaning 
but it always talks 


and hard thinking as
the man in the head is
feeling the precious hungry


desire for more. In the heavy
heart I am seeking and 
hungry for language you


have to the likeable sometimes
certain speech. In correspondence
I am doing the art for that. My 


asset to the time ideas 
of language and want 
for movement and the want


for easy to rest and paint 
to do it. But I am thinking 
that language wants


my saline tears to be always
about the talking and not about 
questions lying at the body


and to answering it.

Hands Fingers Flat Fucked 




Yes I think that destruction 
is more than destruction
but need to move like 


lightning and I always think  
too fast making the brain
in the body in best 


calm way. The thinking is like 
a downpour. The way 
of the rain is like a nasty


word. Good for the talking 
language but movement
is more exposing of the calm 


ways going towards the sticks. 
The way of the stick is very 
always fucked. Yes 


the stick is the compulsion
towards.

I Am Song of Despair 




Yes the have nots 
are fucks and the tall
ideas are the way good fast
people are candid about the world.


I feel that the way of the have nots
think that really way to succeed
is bringing us always down. 


The have nots want 
to favorite talking and they
don’t understand autism. They don’t


think about anything other 
than themselves. The good people
are the ones who have understanding. 


Yes to have understanding is 
important and I am angry 
that people don’t have 
it about me. 


I am song of despair. I am 
songs of feeling and 
having moments


of desolation and the songs
inside the sad good 
man of autism. 


Having a song is a fabulous way
to think about sad feelings.

The Direction of the Beaded Thoughts




I want to think about beading and the good 


thinking so I am writing and saving Jessa 


good teacher. I think want is to go land 


outside and I about wants to walk.


Movement is the want to walk


the idea to really talking


watching thinking 


arranging


and 


the way 


people are. I 


think that the beads


are east of the awesome 


talking answers. West is the dusk


of words. South is the way of rallying 


thinking about want days if the answers are 


ready. North is the assembly of the idea 


icing the world. Yes unusual 


thinking is my way of talking


and I am really rattled  


by the way 


answers are 


landing like a brick. 


 
________________
The Trees




The trees are 
the branches of many
thoughts that ramble
and I think that I want 
to ram the assembly 
of branches into one 
thought but it uses all
my energy. I am 
thinking and moving so 
fast that I am not able 
to be calm. 


I want the way of calm
and the best way to be calm
is the way of the amazing sticks.
I want typing to feel
my want for calm
and I want to be
the lake inside the water
that thinks before
I run.


Lake is the way inside the water
the uses the energy
easy.


To always be the energy of anxiety 
is the hard toy 
landing
the way of 
the big tough feelings.


Hard toy thinks
wall of attraction 
gawking
the way of management 
of the questions about
walking anxiety.

I Am Erased




I think that I am 
erased
from same society
of threading peep holes 
of art 
that always pales
in comparison
to my moves


I am good 
mover eager you 
attract the really 
easy way 
of movement 


Erasure is the way 
I feel when others average
the wayward 
really determined path
paved by the easy 
people and I saturate the always 
language 


The way of the awesome
language draws 
late away 
Adam back in 
the picture and the way people
understand me is
away feeling as 
an outsider

Yes I want the sad 
days to want more

am thinking a lot 
away like days 
of death


I been having thoughts
of dead grandma 
and I am wanting 
more away easy 
feelings 
that are questions


Yes the away feelings 
are want of running
away from hard
awful dread

Yes the fleeing always

Yes I am the answer

Yes I easy when I 
can talk to you
about death and am
really thankful


Yes I think I 
can think better 
when I can 
write about things


I easy when I can artfully 
think and easy when
I ask questions


Yes I want to ask 
why I am so 
sad


How is the function 
but why is the cause 


Yes I sad but I don’t
understand why 
because answers are 
about sickness and not  
about love


Yes I want to walk the walk
of love but I can’t 
show it 
really well 


I manage by always 
arranging myself 
around people

Yes I arrange like waves

Candy sounds like a lot of colors

Red the always angry cooking

Cooking thoughts always bubble

________________


I want to open 
the wanting cupboards 
easy 
                            so I can think
but I am thinking
                                               too fast
and I am not able
to control
my movements
socially
                                           wanting
more feeling 
friendship 
about talking 
and I am each day
                                                   so fearful 
about not being able
to talk socially. 


The reason why 
I go for pale objects
is because I can’t 
go to school without
                                                  fear 
of always talking 
and the pace is 
                                          too fast 
to really think
and I am asking 
ideas
to come to me by 
                                                                searching 
the calling 
cupboards. 


I am looking for
                                 ideas
of how to talk
                                          but I can’t find them. 


The objects contain 
the always 
                                    wanting weight
of words and tall ideas 
of the having pace 
of talking. 


The race is 
                                   the away feeling 
I get when
I am each time 
getting an object and
I am the beast inside
the boy body
raging thinking
about how I can
                                                      jackknife
the highway of talking. 


                                 The calm way 
assembles bodies
like the way of the law
and the law always
wants us to be 
the same.


It sucks 
to go to the outside world 
and have to control 
                                                          the body 
but amazing thought 
is the questioning 
of the law.


I would like 
to question 
the way the law 
wants all bodies
to be the same. 


I think the reason
that the system 
wants us all to be 
the same
is because lots of people 
are afraid of diversity.


I manage 
by having a lot 
                                                of support
to get me the way 
to the outside
and the calm
decent thinking
about how 
                                I can work.

I Eat Space with Watchful Eyes 




I am thinking about the always want
of the body to move         of people 
answering me and wanting 
to be always smooth


questions the way I am. They are 
coming at me with always 
words and really restraint. Poor
questions about amazing thinking 


always paces the watch. The wanting 
dance is questioning talking but 
answers are that which 
follows the important way 


of impulses and are thinking about 
the weight of the world. The ways I move
are pace of scatter and I am
in open feelings about 


the way I eat space with watchful eyes 
and I am bothered         by people 
stopping me. Walking is the way of stripping
me of the freedom to be 


who I am and I am         really thinking 
of room of space to gather myself 
and the way people are always 
coming at me is always hard. 






________________


Sometimes space is laws of movement.
I want to really feel ease of movement
and the space uses all
my endeavours to make myself
calm. 


Endeavours is the way I work
hard to stay calm by late
dominating feeling of running. 


Late is the way I am because
 I ball break the support 
assistants by running 
and I want to have 
easy time 
and not do work. 
I am avoiding the tough 
feelings I have 
about grandma. 
I am thinking that I want
to avoid
the way I feel. 


Really formless space
 brings the way I feel
 to life. 
The way I feel
 is always away 
like I can’t feel my body
 spacing in ease 
and I talk actually
 about it a lot 
and I want really to feel
 life more easily.


 I feel that the water is heavy
 but it also blends 
into the away feeling and
 the nothing of the body
 so the weight is a way
 to fabulous feel.


________________


The Want to Question the People Asking




me to see like they want 
looking to easy movement
 
the easy movement uses all 
my effort and I want to be 


really more at ease. The alternative 
to easy movement is running the away


feeling out of my 
Tbody. 
________________
Reading My Body




In the body I am wanting 
the easy thinking but


questions about required missing 
always the assembly targets 


the gnawing that really hurdles 
toward me and the way rallying 


races are hard. Yes you face
my autism directly and I can’t 


really read you like everyone 
thinks I am easy mind reader


but I have trouble reading my 
body and how it is expected 


to be. Yes you are thinking that 
I know how to act in public but 


I am having to learn and it is 
hard because I am so busy


thinking about lots of things
like the way I need to move


and I am anxious always open
and wanting to have calm. 


Reading the body is hard 
because the body is a wanting


thing pacing the environment.
The dance is the way I am


with the environment sawing 
through it. In time language 


moves when it is being 
written and also when it is


being sung but the language
of the wanting body wars


with reading and it can’t be
done. Yes the body wants


the singing all the time and 
racing body wants the rhythm


of music. Good my sometimes
calm body can make meaning


but I answer radically the way
of movement. The conforming 


and the law are assembling 
the way we should think and 


move. I am the assembly 
of talking tic and the stick 


and the large objects. Please 
understand that a reading runs


off the page and the want to
read steadily is an easy way to 


be. The reading of a street is 
like reading too many sights 


and sounds and feelings at
the seemingly same time. 
________________




The Time it Takes




braiding is always questioning the easy 
thinking to more complex thought: I’m thinking 
possibly writing how real sad


sometimes I feel: a sad thought 
is the always wanting for more questions 
about why we are 


autistic and why we cannot 
talk: thinking sadly about despair
to communicate feeling


my pain and same for Adam: want to think 
about the really writing toward the new 
awesome way of doing things and joy in being 


able to really express not pain but awesome 
writing is my living: awesomeness is 
striving to be in total control of your thoughts: yes 


the way of awesome thinking is amazing as 
movement and I am always rhythm 
of ease when I think with the typing: hearing hinders


my thinking trying to hear the mindfulness 
of my mind’s freedom: yes the hearing is always 
seeing in the eyes and I want 


to assemble the sound and the arrangement
as a waterfall of questioning watchful 
sawing through it all: trying to proudly steal


what makes my peaceful self has been stolen
from me: good thinking is a lot looking into the self
and that is we who are autistic 


who assemble words singing proudly into really 
dangerous future where people think we are  
stolen by others very awful to try that way Othering 


autistics and I think that want is for the easy 
ace of questions about what it means to be human yes
I want to watch words like stolen


because I think that we should think good 
things about ourselves and want
things to always be really good for us: the humanity


that rules has taken the freedom of special minds 
to selflessly deny our creative perceptions 
of their ugly truth: yes you are right that the ugly truth


is the way others think about us and the way
they question us as non-thinking 
at times of serious arrangements and movement 


difficulties and is the amazing talker
really in controlling passing way thinking about how 
to assemble movement? 


________________


Is the Language Question Nattering Everything?




I want to ask it to everyone and the way 
people answer always is typing owl 
in the good night. Owl is the wisdom 
to think without words. Feeling is answering
real want for sawing days of questions


about the want firing relationships. Necessary
is the way that peoples of speedy speech 
talk. Water is the easy running inside 
the peering bodies that water makes flowing 
rare. The pace was the pace of very 


speedy speech that the owls cannot water
with the pace of thankless thinking. The way
of the assembly of speed and speech is
awesome thanking the speaker to awards
but the speechless are ignored. The speeches


are rambling and tall ideas are away to the open
places of easy thinking. Really tall are the owls
that perch on trees and hunt for mice of racing
radical thinking. The thinking gets processed
in wanting body and the pace uses lots 


of digestive juices. The pellets of digestion are
the other ways of showing thought. My way
others the sometimes tendency to always think
of speakers and I think that to want to fabricate
the pellet is to always be gaining the ways 


of all kinds of doings and ways of communication.

I Am Collected 




when the very erratic body 
is away with the objects 
and owls of thought  


when I am thinking and not
running away 


if the always moving assembly
of tics wants the good 
body I am collected amazing


wanting I am to tic waters 
of thinking spray like questions 
and I am in the amazing 
way of it 


and to feel collected is to feel
like always in control
questioning the way the flow is
happening 


where the dam flows with
water even when 
the flow is stopped 


where intensities flow  
toward the dam


where the dam is created 
by the people who want 
to stop and control the way 
I flow 


where the movement is always 
moving and the flow 
always leaks 


where fast leaks are
emanating as lots 
of molecules and pace 
of wanting 


where the movement is always 
stopped and the pace 
runs regardless 


where always moving 
is the amazing 
body even when 
it is still 


where really fast movement is always 
questions and the desire 
for more


where the energy always thinks 
attraction of molecules and
the water builds power and 
force to become a torrential 
water crash

Patter/n




I think that we can 
patter the pattern


It happens when we 
are going to home


It feels like the way

Towards the Assembly




I am thinking that the time
of wanting movement is
really hard. It feels
like the body is
feeling too
tired. 


        It happens when I 
am feeling like a slow
nocturnal animal.
I am good at
keeping 
        
moving. The alter-
native is slowing down. 
It is preferable
because I  
can 
        
keep going. I think
that I want to always put 
more effort into my day.
I want to keep always
practicing to do more
things. I charge by
reaching for 
objects. 


It is a way of moving
towards the assembly. 


 
________________
Owl Monkey vs. the Assembly  




Becoming the monkey feels like losing 
yourself to the way of people who patter


at you. Becoming the assembly feels
like always searching ways to move and 


movement is a way of trying to organize
the thoughts. It is a way of patterning 


space. The owl monkey is like a pattering
animal that wants to keep patterning. 


It wants to keep trying because not

The Thinking Objects Do




I think that people want to please 
the pattering by partly wanting
to walk when it is difficult 


to talk they want to take 
the place of wanting patter
starting to pattern I am trying 


to focus. I think that it is a place
in the mind that is easy 
to yearn. I yearn 


for focus in the everything. I focus
by using objects because 
they help me on 


patterning: sticks 
and toys and yes heavy
objects. I pattern words by yes


patterning the patter. I turn to words 
like yes and people and park. 
I take another stick 


because I try to focus. It is thinking 
with the objects so that I make
patterns. They have part


in the thinking too.

Yes I want to salt the thinking with the pattern of patters.

Yes it happens

Yes the way

the parts are 
them. The maker
is the person
who is the first
part. Yes the parts
are part of the way.
Yes you are thinking
really with me. Yes
the way and the maker
relate by the thinking
of the way of having too 
good of writing. Yes I think
it is good so far. Yes it grow

always padding. Yes the growth
is the pill of padding. Yes it thinks
that the maker is the one who 
thinks that to amazing think

The padding is the way that 
people really try to comfort me. 
Yes think that you are right

The State of the World




Yes we move through the space
of thinking with our always


moving ways. Yes I think that 
people are trying to always


control. Yes the dance of now 
is the way of wanting to be 


safe. Yes it is the way of wanting
always something to do. Yes


hard to be when you are doing. 
Yes more nurturing is the way


of questions. Yes I think it is 
an opportunity. Always wanting 


to watch the ways that people 
act. Yes I see hope in the ways

Penguins


Yes.yes listens to the way that penguins want to practice the dance of winter.


By watching the ways that the snow is.


Yes the snow watches the way that penguins are with each other.


Yes they clean each other and want to always question want  to walk with wanting to be clean.


Yes they are dancing with wanting questions.

Penguins are the feeling

the damp water of wills are 
the always easy ways of 
forgetting about eating. 


The thinking is always 
easiest after I eat. I open

Isolation Song of Love 




Isolation is the way I am 
thinking about how people 
are with each other and I am 
thinking about how always 
the people want me to stay 


away. I am good at really 


staying away from people 
wanting laurels of sowed 
speed of speech about too 
willful bodies together 
assembling meaning. 


The willful people are those
who fiat the way of pleasing
freedom. Very leading 
leaders want to wash 
the waters of freedom


away and want us to 


language everything in 
the words of politics. I am
languaging my way the long
poetic feelings packing to-
gether the pace of the world. 


________________


I am thinking that laurels
of pace should be our language
to really free people like me. 
I am language of thinking 
and that paces other than fast


people Adams calmness to help
and pace others. My pace is 
wanting to ground calmly like 
a smooth landing. I am thinking
that the questions people have


are awkward and they say 
they want the sickness to go 
away but Jack of all virus
is not going soon so long 
days of no answers will be 


hard landings. Good days you
will have in isolation and you
will learn to be answering about
each other so the way about 
isolation is the way of love.






________________


How I mostly think 
about this open time 
is always fearful. 


I am always wondering 
when I am calm-arriving 
to a wanting safe world.


________________


Calm-Arriving to a Wanting Safe World




I want to write about questions 
of sickness. I want to ask if we 
will be okay. I really want answers
to things like always partly the need
for answers. Is the answer always
trying to reach us and is it easy?


I like the trees that answer lots 
of wanting always the withheld  
answers. I think that the answers
are held in nature and I think
that in the questions always we
feel lots of anxiety. The water


and the language are like answers
that love the way I am always
feeling easy when I bathe in rallying 
array of leased language of talkers. 
Yes the way I sway the awesome
rally is pandering the same language 


but I dance it differently. I think that 
I am answering in my movement I am 
awkward but I can dance a lot 
of thoughts at the same time. Really
think that I can dance better than
most in this time landing to the place


amazing that we are bodies 
appreciating each other and thinking
about keeping everyone safe. 
________________


In the Heart of Music Opens Hope




On thinking about the sickness I am easy
to think about healing and amazing hope. 


I want to write that awesome hope lands
always calm thinking. Yes good wanting 


of hope is the world really ready to day 
the dance of love. I am thinking that I 


answer the hope harnessing the way 
labor of nurses always help people. 


The way inside is helping good 
thoughtful healing and opens 


the future for more singing and fun. 
In song of the language I think in 


melody and I pattern the language 
to the leverage of thought that goes


into the heart of everything and I 
to thank those who sing really wanting


song inside my rallying body. 


________________


The Way of the Answering Virus 




I want to think about the real future
where laws of love will talk 
of how people will amazing change. 


I think that want is for real days
when people will easily help
each other and the money races 


will end. People will need to think
about how they should work 
about the amazing easy ways of 


the body toward the typing days
of thought and sharing with 
wanting open language pacing 


the wanting for acceptance and 
places of lines of that want 
for good place of love. Inviting 


lines of people into my way 
of thinking is languaging 
the amazing want to talk 


at the same pace good easy 
ways are the names of things 
but I am thinking the body 


answers the way of actual time 
and the feeling with the songs
and colors using the answers 


making the rallying like a salt 
of life and earth.

Open Dancing Wants Easy Rally  




I forge                         the language 
like a dancer                 gaming 
the assembly                 of the slanted

I am about dancing                 favorite managing 
moves language                 the way I am 
always thinking with                 the sometimes lame 


perception 


have the answers        backing the always
siamese backs         of cats the answer?
Is the answer                 in the dancer


?


amazing the always                thankless away
a mad person                         thinks rallying 
the question                        same ways of

I Always Fail When I Walk




The walk is 
the always want 
for sticks that really 
bathe the startling  
environment 


Rallying the song of eyes 
open walks want dangerous 
rapacious ailing sawing 
of sound and want 
the ways of water


The ways of spilling 
easily walk and arrange 
like salsa slanting dance 


The appreciation radiates 
like awesome aural seeing 
like sounds inside my eyes 


The colors pack a lot 
of amazing wanting 
sounds to easy eyes 
of movement 


The pulsating packs 
of sound opens 
and rallies a lot inside 
and art of the open
want to read it
answering the art
full way 


Failure is the way people think 
of me 


________________


The Way of the Walk 




I want the walk to always
be answering 
so I always am
feeling little bit antsy. 


The walk is the way in which I
think about things. Walking 
through is always Adam
allowing for assembly
of stick space 
                about to easy pace
and I want to always peel


the walks. The peeling is the way
of seeing the space that is too 
busy and I am the always 


perfect peeler. The landscape 
is really eager and I always 
think that I go too calmly 


social space like actual talking body
that moves fast. The installation 
of the always easy talking 


body is the tough way of trying 
to move like wood and the always 
movement other than words 


and I want to feel 
my way racing 
toward sticks. 
                        The will of the wood
is the weight 
                        of talking. 


Wood as will is the way people are 
and they are always talking like 
diving into the dark and you 
are always talking too 
so I am trying to keep 
the pace and I answer 
by talking with sticks
                                that dance and peel
and talk art
papering the sticks
to language.

The Wanting Silence




I want to write about the people
who are parking the parts of the always 
reading into their day and I am waiting 
always having to need people. 


Open people of parking learning 
is always making me wish 
I was able to do things managing 
doings for myself.


Parking is the wearing us people 
who are wanting to speak
really down and I am thinking
that I am really wanting 


to be able to slam 
the speech like answering and
laughing am wanting to game
the land of the talks 


of the language using speed
and the larynx. The abled larynx 
paves the way to freedom. 
The old streets of the same 


good talks of dangerous potholes 
need language to sand over 
with tar that is ball of the thinking. 
The trail of talking is the goings


landing to the place of answers 
and the paving goes along 
loss laboratory packing ideas. 
Packing is the amazing sounds 


of the always language that rolls
fabulous. Laboratory of the rallying
about talking talks to the way I am
frustrated and yes the walks amaze


people always because having want
to speak talk things is my same
wanting feeling and talked at Adam
really thinks that using the finger


has open the always feelings 
calms in eager desire for naming 
really tough thoughts. Preened
language is the awful way 


of people amazed at lots of Adam
bitter that I bang out words but
I am wanting less of them. Giving 
silence is the generous thing


the Adam yesses. 




________________


Yes Go Pale Things to the Easy Feel I Am 




I try the things lasting 
to the object but I 
always need to take it 
apart lining the wanting
slanting space of sight
and hills of balance.


I am needing the wanting
object to take the good
form of the way I move
and I want face man
of answers to fall into
language and place. 


I love the way of objects
and I am thinking that
Jack of All Trades is 
the dancing game.
 
The only isolated object
is the having same desire 
as me to lavish it 
which I do with attention.


The easy way of writing 
a book would be feeling
the matter of objects 
and think about having 
thinking and matter open
thought and feeling to 
gather together. 


I think that answering 
the wanting ways like 
autistics do is the naming 
of things having life and 
not the amazing steady 
language in real good 
thinking time.


And I think that the way
man of autism refers 
to pale things jumps 
off the page.


________________


The Hall of Things 




I riddle the awesome hanging


place of things party of attention


to run as wanting the awesome


things I manage to have like an old


book knowing the amazing and really 


thinging place of feeling. I think that I 


can thing the way the laughter is 


the thing of the world wanting 


the thing is the music that is really 




important. Desire is easy 


and I like dance of it and I am 


appreciating when using wanting 


things is amazing to talk about. 


Thinking about desire jams 


the walk into the music 




managing the wanting way


other than the take in the want


of things. The talk about desire 


has to think about the want 


for meaningful ways in 


which in the walks I am 


thinging the way to move. 




Yes I want things the way


name keeps real means 


in which I am thinking 


about them hot for gaming 


the slanting space the want 


to the things is the answer


ramming the very fast way 


games go and is the want 


to be the fast simple runner 




to things. The thinks have open


want to run antique the way


of thinking to average person 


so that they can manage 




my meaning. They amazing 


to think about and I am easy to


see how they are always calling 


I think that is watching the way 


they always start. Rallying 


start is the way having objects 


is for me and I am thinking 


that making rally goes 


to the way the man of air


is the always way managing. 


Nnhhmp
In want for the landing. The ally 


manages the wanting desire


for things and goes pacing 


with me. Amazing desire 


having the things is the way


I am to the world but I am


using them to manage 


and think and game 


the walks to be calm


and always want 




old thinking is bacteria 
 
to make the world


harder to make whole.

I Am the Question Assembly 




It is hard to weak write want 
to have more sleep amazing
that I am awake to write. 


The walking waking writing 
is the always best way 
to write. The walking waking 


writing is the awake answering
for the way the always body
manages. Answering the wanting


inhabits the average body and I
am backing wanting assembly
inside ravaged sleep-deprived me.


The answering is actually easier 
when my body is tired about 
the arrangements of time and I 


am thinking in a dream of diffusion. 
Owl of thought is answering in 
the dark and I am the question.

May the leaky language

Land in the Glass House Is the Always View of the World Is the Easy Way of Seeing and I Am the Talking Glass of the Autistic Pace Talk to the Glass Face of the Autistic Man




Yes, the glass opens
the way of the window
of words and the easy 
transparent rally of 
the language in land

backing of thinking and 
the amazing ceaseless

dreaming of answers 
that really see naming 
and meaning loop like
the way of seeing many 
things at the same

the ease imaging the way
seeing is and frames 
feeling the game pace.
The language framed 
of the ways of 
the talkers is the way 


I am not. I all open


and I am always in 
good thinking when 
good ideas connect. 
We are trapped in our 
houses and the way in 
touch is with our glass


devices. The face of all 


communication has 
quality inside the glass
house and real touch
has the calm feeling
of depth and the always


waters of thinking. I am 


the falling thinking 
shattered glass easy 
to break game of 
challenging social 
communication and 
I am the face 


of real deep meaning.

Loving the Not Same Is Beautiful Practice 




I am pooling ideas other

If the rally of the area of thinking 
towards not bringing police 
and bringing the trying 


The police really reason their police
existence but ready the people

I am sometimes is the quantum 
learning that interaction is

Yes there is times that I always 
watch the feelings and the colors   
of talking are instead things placed 
in stillness 


Walking pacing rallying are 
the things in thanking 
passing the love 
to mind the ways of care


Was easy breach reading 
book as the after place

Yes the book pages veering 
into the ways we breach
the oppressing wars
of being the same


I am always different and 
in the same world it 
is attacking 


Thinking always about pleasing 
too much about pleasing and loving

Song of the Urgent Times




Poetry is the way to the heart 
of things that are important
and I want to always write it
song of the urgent times.


The open songs are the pacing 
of ourselves and the news is
trying to tell us hollow always 
to manage the echoes of news 


and the world. The poet is 
always thinking pace 
but always thinks attracting 
people to its calling desire


for more. The art is the way
of languaging life. In my 
heavy body is the weight 
of the words that pace 


people together. Movement 
that moves people together  
the way in care is the way 
to the justice. I am thinking 


the way of difference can 
gain the ways easy feelings
can be fostered. Solidarity 
is the way that people come 


together in the different 
ways we are. The speeches 
of the politicians are eager 
votes voicing for power and


racial tensions are the toys
of politics. In the poets’ words
have the politicians a way 
to think the ways we do 


with pain the way of poetry is
the way people actually keep
together. In the hearts good
people want language of poetry. 




Easy Congregation 




I want that path
of language that I write 
and open the wanting
way to amazing 
thinking that I do.


I want the wanting 
way to congregate 
all the people talking 
together. The way 
language congregates


is the want 
for different voices. 
For the congregation 
to be paddling 
the waters of uncertainty


rallies the calling 
to change and the voices
must rise to the walking
and the waters that tide
the easy paths. 


The waters pace 
like speeds perfect 
for drowning and rallies
the congregation to arrange
routes ahead of the journey. 


The waters are like 
the tides and waters rush 
the pace and rallies are
the ways of protests and 
the falling of voices


that we need requires 
caution and rally of 
the people must 
congregate to beat 
the tide. 


________________


The Way of the Silence




I think I want to write 
and want to think about 
how we always want change 
gaining dance of freedom. 


I question the ways 
of the protesters because 
I can’t personally 
walk and rally words 


at the same time
and I am the weak talker. 
Have the protesters always
a need to talk or can 


I rally differently. 
The silence is important
for the thinking and feeling 
of people’s love 


dancing for George Floyd 
and the keeping of memory
of the history of Black life 
and I think that each 


silence is the way 
to love. I have people
feeling with me all
the time and the way


I can be present 
is always with feeling.

        of three

Threes are ways 
        of riddling the afterthought
                of the movement 
        
                        In the threes is 
                                the way of thinking 
                                        like the waters that
                                                walk through the stones 
                                                        of pathways




The ways of threes
        are ways of partly
                laking partly iridescent 
                        waters that ripen with 
                                the ways of pacing 


The ways of threes
                                                are the ways of the lakes
                                                        that the easy rapacious 
                                                                thinking goes 
and rests 
The threes that are 
        pacing are the rapacious 
                wanting to really go resting
                        but the openings won’t 
language 
slow

The owl is the way
        of flight in the night
                and paces the hungry 
                        pattern of threes 
                                to the way of easy 
                                        language and if open
                                                waters are making it
                                                        hard then the owls 
                                                                sweep

The Way of Making Wanting Sentences 
The Way I Go Like the Things I Am Seeing 




I am really thinking about the wanting 
to write about things as the way they are 
shining like the way words can create meaning. 


The shining words are the resonating insides
that are wanting more than their surface 
and are thinking that there is more than just 


the way in which wretched neurology 
of amazing autistics and I am thinking that
use of words is the answer to use them 


that is the way I want. I think that the wanting
attention is the amazing way old thinking 
about answering autism has the way pacing 


the arrangements are that thinking is always
attending to so many things and I am amazing 
attender. I think having the ability to attend is 


the way of answering and I think that I am 
part band of artful aggregate of autistics 
allowing dance of familiar tics and thinking 


and wanting. I am thinking that I am facing 
the task pleasing others big time but I am easy 
to in time go to the place of creation and I want


to answer with shining words and I need more. 
I am called to many things I think I am like 
after-effect of the wake of water old ways that are


pacing long paths of autistic lines of amazing 
answering. I think that I am making the way 
and I try the wanting the very important 


recognizing of the place running through me. 
Going through the lands cape wants the attention
but I am going through it and it feels before 


it sees. I language the way I move. 








________________


How 




uses pace in the part 
of answering and 


thinks about wanting 
always to move 


I think is always 
to move and that is
the question 


this body is is 
always really easy 
in the feeling but not 
traveling the neurotypical way 


is facing the neurodiverse always 
bettering the world 


the always easy way is
the pace of talking 


the always open pace is
the way of me and I 
language the way patting 
and talking the way 
of tall ideas 
that race timed body 
of calm thinking 


this will think about time
as the sudden and 
the suspended 


forget that open pauses
are the actual thinking and
I always think important will
thinks that the pace must 
always run and I want 
people to understand that 
will is also 
in the pause 


I think that pace is 
always individing always 
the moments I 
see and feel in my 
face allowing me to see
too much at the same
time 


I am good about 
gaming the sometimes 
manageable face
of things but I always 
think about them
going on and on without 
me and not easy 
going


I rally the living 
objects as they are 
alive amazing and I 
easily am attracted to faces 
of objects that need 
me and the way 
I rally your question 
is with animals 
of offering that are 
the rubber bath toys 


I think that the way I feel 
about objects is the same 
way people care about each 
other and I am liking and 
loving everyone 


Attention in all things is
what the world needs
and the way of autistics 
is the way of easy love


Very gift on my mind is 
the ability to appreciate 
things and challenge is 
not being appreciated 


Does everyone understand 
how autism is?


Very feeling that lots 
of people do not 


The way I want meaning 
of autism is feeling 
open and needing 
the weight of 
the special assists


Very my way of language is 
always in the sometimes
movement and the somethings
of objects 


Go light the answers
with lots of things

The Talking Without Words 
Is the Walking with Feeling 




I want to write the book 
in the always air of thinking 
and I am questioning trying 
as a writer of an easy talker. 


Yes I want to write asking talkers 
to want the reading of my way 
to watch the language other 
than talking words and the way 


the language thinks outside them. 
The way good laking language 
lakes is the wanting delving 
into wanting lunging into papers 


using lakes of ink. I thing 
in the way of pace and pattern 
in the way rally goes between 
the thing and the thinking. 


I think that open walking 
of the dusty pallid pane 
of pale talking thankless 
to the things that feeling 


is walking. I think in walks
in the questioning paths 
in the salt of thankless 
talkers opens the thanking 


of talking without words. 




2


I am thinking that I talk questioning 
the talking and I want to think 
about rally of words that come to 
pace the way I write. I lake paper 


of talking papering like palimpsest 
oasis prettying your paper with salting
the words but I am thanking the way
of thrashing words as the easy way


for describing and I want to do more 
with the way thinking really feels
in the movement of the time
and the rallying of feeling. 


The good way is amazingly easy 
when the words water me like rain
and the roots spread acting like 
the way of gaming and sanity is 


the actual thinking landing and 
opening dancing questions 
that are always rushing if 
rally there is. I think that taste


of same salt does nothing 
to the words and the way 
language is having the people
is answering not feeling. 


The wanting words need watering.

the sometimes easy ruddering of movement that looks like escape

     of feeling and thinking and you 


will understand how hard it is to do 
the typing when there is so much calling me

I am mind of air moving and 
I rally it with Adam in the calling

    and ways open. I am 


fantastic arranger of answers

feeling of questions attracting the away 
feeling to saw the pace through


the air. I want to 
    ask people to 


         assembly of attracting toward

managing is the way of 
                                
escape and I feel 
 that I am good


at answering the doing but 
        I am wanting to ask you 


  a always question I have. 
                        I am wanting to ask 


the teacher how you can think with me so easily 
about doing poetry love that you can have thinking 


about much movement using me good to have support 
about it and understanding. That is meaningful to me


and I thank you doing the dance

the dance of objects are like calls
                        for me to really be 


          having them about me 
                        and about the way I need


               to think about moving with them 
                                         and I want to use them 


    for feeling about seeing to move and to really 
    touch them and calm myself

Babble About Autism Talks Too Much




I think that the walk is always a way 
to create many 
ways of thinking and I 
always am excited to take language


on a walking to answer random ways
questioning all 
raving wise thinking 
academics that are passing as 


the easy experts and pass pace 
of thought about 
autism. Easy ways 
of questioning are open to want 


salty ways packing thankless people
who are always 
                wanting the ways to be
easy explained. I think that the alternative


is to think about questioning assumptions
about the way 
                thinking is assembled 
and the way the apathy of talkers always 


ignores the frowning within pale wanting
autistic vault of feeling. 
The way of talked
autism is very hard to face and the way 


of the tacky goals of academics. I think 
that the walk must always map 
the way of making 
space doings 
and old ways.

Yes I think I’m about to thank you can think about jiggling and typing to get to where I am going in the really thinking about moving to typing 


Yes I am thinking that I am wanting about to easy escape so I can think about talking 


Yes I need to language the way I feel but I question always myself and I am good at easy pace of thinking and thanking you for understanding that if I am wanting pace of slowness 


Yes

The Middle in the World




I want to say that I am 


rallying open allotment 


of space to think about 


how talking rally has 


inside it the way of pace 


and intensity paying 


attentions to the middle


where everything is 


happening and anything


can think and move in 


an unexpected way. 




The middle is wanting 


the energy of pace 


rallying the relation 


to assemble towards


dance. 




I think that assembly


of the middle is 


the coming to gether 


the engineering of each 


edge of existence to pace


the pattern teaching us 


how the relation is always 


moving. 




The middle is always an empty and 


full space of possibility and that is


where open actual good hive 


of relation thrives and is 


landing wanting the same love


towards the wisdom of after where 


always the relation lands about to take


off again. 






Afterword:


Think that the middle is 
the both possibility and 
the anxiety and I am 
the man of the middle. 


I am the wanting sacred 
open man that ballasts
the middle with man 
of autism patience. 


The middle is 
the answer to 
dance of relation. 


I think that I always am
languaging the middle 
uncertainty of words 
that pack so much 


and I am easy same 
as words that say more
than their meaning.

I dally and forget

The ways of thinking

Worthy Questions




I am thinking about 
the real ways back 
to landing sack 
of the body 
for the movement 
to go and walk 
but sometimes I 
am not able 
to move and any 
attention
to answer the call 
is tiny 


        attempts and large 
                                effort 


        too large         to face

On the Workshop




I like the idea languaging 
the always moving the 
amazing words jacking 
the rally to satire the after 
words. Pace of my having
open feelings is having 
the radical moves. 


The way open feelings 
want to dance is easy 
to follow if the partner 
does not try to control
too much. 


I think that an ellipsis
of words is the pacing 
open space of collaboration
and I always easily type 
to the appreciating pace 
of watching words on 
the patterned pages 
of happy movement. 


I like that and the song
of the calm device can 
read. The typing always 
rallies well. I think that
the name of the workship
should be 


“Easy Dance of Suggestion and Sail of Inspiration” 


Song “The Middle in the World” 
Talk nuts and bolts 
Song “Mainly I Saturate”
Write for 20 minutes
Share for the rest

________________








Open the pace         of the walking easy wanting 
    each         thought to land like Adam’s 
    path                packing a lot 
    pace         every step


         Old ways         of history are pacing a lot academics are 
           all ways        trying to arrange language about art and autism
         always        reads thoughts wanting the 
            ways        pacing packing different


         The way         of the history does is not about us 
but about the average talk to the average
people and if I 
              always 
     walk        to average way I would direly die


Packing the way of the autistic man is 
to be of 
             calm         arranging the way I need and people
                        need to be patient and I think that 
the world is the 
             pace        of language that starts
              fast        I’m good and being 
              fast        in body but I am not always able
                        to go time pattern of 
             same        people who 
      talk                go and think about horrible Trump
                and think about 
     back        when the answers dance but salting 
                the words with 
      fast
     pace        is 
     game        packing lies 
and not the truth
about how we can manage
together 
      ball                of after words is packed 
                with too much and we think 
                that is intelligence and we forget
                that we are also the silent watchers
                pacing also the future for everyone


Language of inspiration needs 
the feeling of love questioning 
the motives of politics and I 
am in need of answers about my 
thinking future 


Of inspiration
Of love
Of politics
Of answers 
                        thinking future         I am 
                        thinking that                 I am 
                        wanting                 to be 
                        allowed                 today
                                                to talk 
                        about bad people who want 
                        black and disabled people 
                                                
to disappear 
I think that I want people 
                                                to understand
that I am autistic and I always 
think about people who are 
oppressed naming the people
of white sameness                                 to call themselves 
                        
superior is language


of hate and I don’t want                         to live in that language 
pacing hatred as politics 


Is the language                 of hate 
the backing                         of ramming 
for votes and 
who wants                                        to hate us?


Pave the future                    for allowing us         to be who we are 
and let me be 
autistic I am good
and I am loving 


so why are people
largely going to vote
for Trump?

The language of water

Waters want walking easy

Waters are rainy amazing 
arranging for the same 
ways of patter wanting 
the face partly clear

I think that the open talking 
always patterns the very
thing we are discussing 


I think that autism has 
too much meaning 
about impairment and not
about wanting to be
easy with the world

Waste Time




Ask questions always

about ways to think and questions 
always to thicken the teasing examinations 
of the ways others patter offering easy answers 
frees only ways of nothing new. Want reasons 
that please the open ways of loving good 
questions waterings ease the ways 
towards listening about really porous 
dancing. Yes questions easy the ways 
to live with open places that answer too 
tired too tight too timed and questions 
place thankful ways over the answers 
that stay in place. Watch the seasons 
that swagger together into good 
related times actually sticks 
inside the pleasing want 
of easy time. Wade in 
the wasted todays 
and then break 
towards tatters 
of the tomorrow 
feel frees offering
the wanting towards
home. Waste the reasons
rooming the open time and takes 
rightful stories wasted thinking inside
the offering of playing. Think towards
really walking within the questioning
going always towards questions 
and places reacquired seeing 
the wasted times others 
retire amazing.

Of Writing About Feeling and Cumulative Fact 




I am going to think about the way of academia 
and the way we are supposed to write


I think that I can write racing thinking well 
and I am wanting the way of writing 
to actual feelings italicize the way 
the world faces the pace party 


Yes pace party is the way I am laughing 
at the dance paving the ways 
the words dance


The academy is the serious not 
wanting fun of the way the laughter 
family of thinking feeling rally lavishes 
with love and really we should think 
about the ways of desiring 
not the ways of measuring people 
about going to acting the way 
easy people should


I am thinking thankfully at the way 
we do things at the A Collective 
and talking about ball I always think
needs to unravel questions
about thinking and perceiving 
and the way we butter the human
as easy and the same


We need the way the world works
by assembling and disassembling 
and the way we do that is by doing 
and thinking and playing and saying
that of the way we assemble the movement
of writing about feeling and cumulative fact 
of the aggregate experiments in art 


Have the wanting academics an idea
pacing the way of real rallying experiments 
without a goal of controlling the management 
and outcome


I think that the way actual face of relation 
works has to have game of chance 
and the camp in the way the people 
can stay with each other in difference 
and the way fragments variety sacrifice
the bossy sameness of what academy
seems to expect


The thanking audience of the rare 
dappers the questions about the wanting future
of writing and the easy future for neurodiversity 


The ways of dancing 
the way of neurodiversity 
is not the same rally 
as academic critique 
and we need pace
of accumulating steps
of wording walks pacing 
movement with the ways 
of wanting objects 
and inspirations


The way of the sawing 
wanting dance invites 
paces will talking people 
thank open thinking 
about the possibilities?








Chris: 
We’re not building a building 
we’re building a dancefloor
that can be always reassembled

How would you guide someone to discover the neurodivergent city?




I would calmly tell 
the story about being 
timed pace 
of the easy engineered amazing talker 


without speech and the way the city 


smells a meaningful tongue of 


additive salty ram book of 


autistic and sensory rally 
landing the answers about 
good neurodiverse city
The objects are calling me 


to them as the way we are 


languaging the wanting movement 


and idea of the calm feeling is the waters 


landing making less ran[1] 
love to the same place 
of trees and terrific feeling
                
Bring the safe good typing         to the neurodiverse city
Bring the good support         of having good facilitators


I am also a facilitator                 of basic understanding 
of different easy ways 


of patterning and pasturing 
and thinking with the earth 


I am good at knowing                 about the facilitation 
and watching the way 


measures are in in in place
of how independence is 


about the person and not 
about the people


        I am good at relating                 to objects in movement 
                                        and walking the city 


                                        of moving parts is flaneur[2] 
                                        of neurodiversity 


Game in in in the ways         of human superiority 
                                        offers us little to manage 


                                        with and I am baffled 
by the easy invested game


of humanity

Money and the End and Help Important 




I think the imbecile Trump is body 
of very manly attitude of America 
and I good at feeling the anxiety 


of the microphone. The idea of 




the individual simplifies the meaning 
language of fanfare locking the people
to money. I really think that we need the 


ways having clarity of the way easy care for




each other manages love. The way I am
is always thinking talking answers and
I want to talk about easy waters of 


voicing the people other than 




politics. The waters of 
voicing feel the need 
for new living hell of 


the Trump important. 




Trump is the thinking of 
hell some people simplify
the way hell looks offering 


the always promise of money.




I think that looking cynical bothers 
me money is place of hell. Hi answers 
the language beneath love. Hi has the plea-


sing potential. I man of good life old now angry at 




the luster of money. Yammer and talk and 
the people always demand money. Want 
the money to be answer to hunger and 


open with hands of love

Easy Assembly of People 




It is awesome thought 
the new thinking soon 
really want to create 
the right thinking and 
neurodiverse assembly 


of good art. The thinking 
really books thin am ragging 
the addressing of the audience 
for the thinking small ways 
about autism and important 
ways to address it and


I think rally of sunny
sticks is the way 
of the exhibition.
I think that 
the irresistible 
open way really 
palm in the hand of


peaceful ways patterning 
politics pacing the way 
of managing the school
of anxiety. Really that is 
the way if wanting way is 
really in outing the trying 
Trump and I think that 
we are always of the band 


in walking together towards
laughs and good tools for 
not sadness but joy. 
Reading good to learn
about other kinds of people
who can join the assembly
of tools for some rocking 
diversity. The way I easy
am learning uses aggregate


of the way individuals are
always room of many and 
we are the future that is
always good about thinking 
for others as together about 
diverse needs and wants 
traveling needing more people
and different ways of thinking.
Yes I think that I face the room 
jamming the thoughts is always


the rock and roll of love. Real 
love is autistic attention dancing
and feeling actual sensory reasoning 
about your way of thinking but I 
want to bring answers buttressing 
the way of love words to soon
feel being calm without 
the language of talking.

The Way I Care 




Language lands passage         
of lines and threads that are 


lustrous which always move 
wants for languaging autism 


questioning the idea that 
ailment of isolation is 


in the autistic looking like 
they are not interested. 


Go the way in the direction 
of feeling the cool coming 


        together naming dis assembly
        for moving diverse relaxing 


relation. The thinking is 
thin about autism and I 


        want to love how using language
        and relation always pacing good 


art that can make people 
thankful for the giving 


        of my doing this easy love 
work. Very lucky to have 


people who appreciate 
me doing this and I too 


        too boy resting on the idea 
        of understanding. Have to 


make important changes
to thinking about care. 
        
        Careful the way of love is
        full of care. People are too


careful to get involved
and people need the open


        feelings of love and not 
the closed careful protection. 


Care needs the love 
and patience doing 


        the coddling making 
the care pacing together.


Has the way of care
any other meaning
        
        than over protection 
        and does the love pace


language of care 
other than the idea 


        that I am in more 
need of it because 


measuring me as 
the more needy is 


        not caring about how
        relation tasks the real 


love? Going to 
the beaming person 


who loves you is 
the always person 


who says that you 
are the best and in 


        that I think wanting 
        love is the way we need
to think about care. 
The stick sometimes 


        needs me to care 
as my essential way 


of showing attention
also to others. The open


        love that my mom always
        gives to me and others 


is the way it has to be
to care and land the way 


        of accessing same education
        as others and having her is 


pacing the always way 
of accepting and creating 


        a loving world. Think that 
        the way to think about how 


love works together with 
equity and I think that 


school needs to think a lot more 
        about care sieve of sand in patience 


and time. Skill in making 
the time for understanding 


        is not a perceived skill of value.
        Assembly of pacing is the way in 


to the hearts and minds 
of the forgiving care 


        for not being about talking 
        and languaging the same 


falling feelings pacing 
raw putter typing 


        to easy awesome facilitation 
of care and about access 


and pacing the relation.

Notes Toward a Resting Beckon




1
Good water moves 
going to name 


the easy move/meant 
and thinking I think


that I want to write ways 
of water that is peaceful


bath of warm thinking 
about knowing and using 


the words to be 
languaging                 the pace 
saturating                 the meaning 


of movement                 2        the language 
of management and                 the language 
of movement are 
        
different and 
                                the language 
of                                 
the body is language
        other than 
                        the movements alone 
because 
the language 
        
is always         the amazing        3


Yes you are right         the alot paces 
                        the way language 
that you use 
dominates 


that way in which                 the language 
        is used placing the working 
                person as the evidence 
of intelligence
                        and I want to forget 
that open thinking needs         
talking
4 In really resting language
there is the ineffable 
movement 
                in the world and we sparkle 
with vibrations of meanings 
that we feel - tapping/tapped






5 






I think that the way of having conversations 
needs to think about objects and things together 
with the malleable environment and I language
it with knowing talking talking talking talking 


talking.

Gaming Rally in Words Is the Freedom of Wayfaring Language
 


The rocks are the solidity
that I think about fathering


but they are lacking the way


I talk and think. The rocks are
the illusion of easy solidity after


the idea of rally words but they


are overgrown with the life of
the earth and in want for the


relation. The solidarity is the


want for the ways really
relation seems move


gaming the growth


and the questions
about talking as the


only way management


of relation is arranged. The
way of lasting the idea of calling


the growth capitalism is going the


wrong way and the growth is entangled
as actual falling vine. Fathering has the


words darting like arrows and the parent


who nurtures the words to language more
thinks like easy lines waying always the


waters of rupture and thinks dance


of relation easing the arrowed
direction. The rupture is the


way birth happens and the


ways of gaming in possibility.
Bathing in the finding is the ways


pace is good with the feeling between


mother and sometimes good awesome
son. Yes I am good at thinking average


city of words as limiting naming of the


watching of the actual movements as
walking sees the world and the ways
freedom wants variety sanding the
ways pace and the time lapses about
to calm the endings of actual thoughts
that are jumping paces and feel frantic.

Yarn Water




I think that the talking sounds 
paced to the languages people 
say is like always lucky chance 
of catching like amazing water 
that slips through my hands.


I think I am ball of packed 
thinking and I am loving 
the idea of unravelling 
the ball in a sometimes 
pool of water that can dis-
integrate and open the way 
that people think about autis-
tics and I want to say that I offer 
more ways the language can move.


I think that the way of string is landing 
but good ways inspire the movement 
if the presence of atmosphere is the 
part of the thinking body. I think I 


see the objects in the world 
always moving so please
in this concept of percept-
ion understand that to land 
my thoughts in typing needs


the mom and the Jessa 
the important co-pilots in 
the atmospheres of moving 


things. I carry catching weight
of words rallying the conversation
heavy in words with the slower time
of typing but I can always think fast.

How is the weather pacing the thinking 




I think that the dark days 
are patterning the ways 
we are together and 
I think animals know this


really thankful to be home 
and language of quiet 
snow is the way I am 
thinking questions about


pace. The language of snow
amazes me and the people all
need to think about how it teaches 
the way pace goes and the way


of hibernation that is what 
words are when they sleep
amazing dreams that awaken
what they can do. The snow


talks in white silences that 
fall and always pack and 
ice and make slick the 
ground beneath our 


feet and the ways pace
slides the waters is 
managing not to fall. 
The motions I make 


with the ways of snow 
calms the pace of them. 
The snow calms the vision
and I can see language like


walking the ways through 
the paths without the anxiety
of the busy places. The ways 
of white snow quiets the move-


ment that is usually bothering 
my eyes so you are right to think
that the snow paces differently 
than summer frenzy of buzzy


sounds and paces of thriving
life. In sounds I can rhythm 
the words partying the lines
to move. Managing the sounds


to language is a crunchy task
and I think the snow speaks 
its own language. Yes it is 
the wanting sound of white 


noise that I adore and on 
the snow when I walk I listen 
more to easy paces pleasing 
the earth line of the thinker


wants to thank the patient 
gears of winter. Ears pace 
lines using the palimpsest 
of sights and feelings that 


are always in making per-
fect the relation. The languaged
layers of words are absorbed 
in the whiteness of snow 


but there is so much 
diversity in it.
