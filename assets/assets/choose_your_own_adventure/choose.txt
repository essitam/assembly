Hi Matisse!

Adam and Imane and I were experimenting with collaboration and we made this. I was inspired by the ideas of fractals, and pick-your-own-adventure stories. I made the form, and Adam and Imane created the poetry.

I really don't think a google form is the best expression of it, but I thought you might be interested to take a look? Some sort of pick-your-own-adventure thing might be fun to play with for the website?

I've listed the four iterations of the trials of time below:

trials of time

v1
words over timeless tracks and watching
timing tacit implosive breathing immaculate strides
Hasting the last pace to face thinning possibilities
mastering streams treasuring havoc to reassemble samples

v2
words over timeless tracks and watching
timing tacit implosive breathing immaculate strides
Hasting the last pace to face thinning possibilities
messing vessels nesting hope to treasure motions teasing meanings timing modes tinted new

v3
words over timeless tracks and watching
water wars with tools that statue time into place
toying teaches to bring ease about waters warping easy thoughts
wait

v4
words over timeless tracks and watching
water wars with tools that statue time into place
toying teaches to bring ease about waters warping easy thoughts
thinking tears time of water. I love water
